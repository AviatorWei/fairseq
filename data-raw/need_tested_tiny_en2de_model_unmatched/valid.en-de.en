For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .
Milli@@ ons of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .
But the reverse is also the case : a well @-@ developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and frag@@ mented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction .
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation , adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States .
Mr President , the symbol of the Red Cross / Red Cres@@ cent movement brings hope to battle@@ fields worldwide .
The second theme emphasised in my report is to positively welcome diversity as a source of social vit@@ ality , economic prosperity and international influence .
We will per@@ severe with such measures .
I remember that too .
As is often the case , this allocation is inadequate to handle the actual requirements .
Mr President , I have to de@@ part a little bit from what I intended to say .
Mr President , I am very grateful to my colleague and friend Mrs At@@ two@@ oll for her remarks about Amendment No 5 , which is in the name of my colleagues , No@@ gu@@ eira Rom@@ án and Or@@ tu@@ ondo Lar@@ rea .
While we are voting in favour of the resolution in question , I would like to point out two issues relating to its text .
Mr President , I should first of all like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , who has put forward a very conc@@ ise and well @-@ presented report and one that we are happy to support .
We need more time to present a properly thought through and fundamentally revised programme .
The living conditions of the Iraqi people , together with the endeavour to achieve lasting security and stability in the area , are the most important issues for the Council with regard to its policy towards Iraq .
Those who have approached me have all pointed out that a number of experts have placed many question marks over those investigations showing that vit@@ amins C , E and A in particular may be dangerous in too high do@@ ses , and that alternative investigations seem specifically to show that high do@@ ses of these vit@@ amins have had positive effects free from side effects .
However , awar@@ ding Turkey candidate country status means that Europe now has certain obligations .
Over the following weeks , however , the number of cases rose expon@@ entially with daily tot@@ als sometimes 50 or more in number .
So my question is : How do you intend to provide information in these countries ?
This question was examined and settled by my services , after the Council had engaged the Commission to do so in December and within the framework of the Nice Summit .
If , however , things go badly , it would be extraordinary if the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , who is also part of the Swedish Government , had no interest in or responsibility for this matter .
My group says a definitive no to this trend .
And Mr Prodi , you asked if Europe was absent from the world stage .
The Commission , together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States , is following the human rights situation in the country closely and participating in all EU dé@@ mar@@ ches to the government of Laos PD@@ R on these issues .
The summit will stress the need to reiterate our determination to pursue the process launched at Lisbon and at Gothenburg .
On the pretext of fighting against terrorism , the European Commission is going ahead with proposals that it has already been working on , led by Commissioner Vitorino , who , far exceeding the necessary cooperation between States , is seeking to go ahead with the supran@@ ation@@ alisation of fundamental aspects of justice .
The criticism from some quarters has been that we , the rich part of the world , continue to exploit the developing countries with the help of our re@@ funds on exports .
The EU can no longer , then , hide behind the Americans .
There are two further points from that text which I would like to emphasise .
The city of Strasbourg and the Al@@ s@@ ace Region have the controlling interest in SER@@ S , own@@ ing 60 % of the shares in all .
Other points , ladies and gentlemen , that were approved in the text and accepted by the Council and Commission as a consequence of this Parliament &apos;s amendments at first reading .
Also it is important that the core labour standards - these ILO standards - are given the dedication and focus needed for their implementation , as indeed the rapporteur so elo@@ qu@@ ently pointed out .
As far as the first question is concerned , progress has not been exactly spectacular .
This is , as a matter of fact , the type of information that Europol is already authorised to request and obtain directly from Member States .
In that respect , we are a strong Parliament and a strong delegation in the negotiations .
Finally , we do not accept the provision in Article 26 ( 2 ) which would prevent Member States from exp@@ elling permanent residents in exceptional circumstances .
The answer is none , so why should that succeed now ?
Naturally we are in constant contact with the United States as regards our position on the Iraqi question .
Moreover , I agree with the principle that the possibility of introducing legislation on individual products should be provided for , with a view to imposing more stringent requirements in the field of safety , use and environmental protection than those already laid down by horizontal legislation .
Before we come to what I hope will be the conclusion to this matter , I would like to thank everyone most warmly : my fellow Members , the staff of the political groups and also the secretariat , all of whom have done such hard work on this .
Moreover , the European Union will also continue to express its general concern in this field - in order to promote the protection of human dignity without distingu@@ ishing between men and women , with particular reference to women &apos;s rights - in international organisations , starting with the United Nations .
( The President cut off the speaker )
I would like to say , however , that the instability and the attacks on the US and UK forces are a problem for everyone - they have been right from the start , right from the first attack - and not just for the coalition forces .
It goes without saying that in its cooperation with Turkey the Commission presses for full compliance with all agreements and provisions relating to the fight against drugs .
The wealth of Europe - and what differenti@@ ates us from other regions of the world , as the Commissioner has said - undoubtedly lies in our cultural diversity , and we must try to export that model .
I fully understand the importance Parliament attaches to bringing the constitutional project to a successful and early conclusion .
This sort of support was specifically excluded from the measures taken against Zimbabwe in order to protect the population and to promote progress .
In one candidate Member State , Romania , a large proportion of the population is now no longer insu@@ red , so they rely on the goodwill of doctors .
Finally , the Eurostat affair .
This brings me to a point that Mr Van H@@ ecke raised : first of all we must try to ensure that rules of origin take into account second @-@ stage products , which help countries to industri@@ alise , and particularly ones such as cotton .
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the chairman of this committee that I myself held this office 15 years ago .
This origin@@ ality is above all that we want to take responsibility for both the civil and the diplomatic and military aspects of such a policy .
So if we can save a child &apos;s life , until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mos@@ qui@@ to in question , we will have to allow controlled use .
Mr President , may I ask whether you were in the hab@@ it of addressing I@@ an Pa@@ is@@ ley as &quot; Re@@ ver@@ end &quot; in the days when he was a Member of this House , and whether the rever@@ end gentle@@ man would have been expected to stand when addressing the Chair ?
Progress in the reduction of emissions in the EU has come to a halt , as the easiest action to make cuts has been taken .
Mr Juncker , we place our trust in you .
The high level pan @-@ European con@@ sortium ...
For me , therefore , the English text will be authentic and I also propose a split vote on the word &quot; binding . &quot;
The European Union is promoting the policy of liberalisation by sacrific@@ ing the satisfaction of grass @-@ roots requirements to the profitability of private investors .
I would also take issue with the asser@@ tion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the nin@@ th EDF .
Under the leadership of President Bas@@ esc@@ u and Prime Minister Pop@@ esc@@ u @-@ Tar@@ ic@@ e@@ an@@ u , a determined and serious reform process has begun there , affecting home affairs , the judiciary and the fight against corruption .
I accept that the ethical issues are a very difficult area : embry@@ onic stem cell research , som@@ atic nuclear cell transfer technology and genetic therap@@ ies for her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary diseases .
Finally , I would like to say that you have not said anything about the Regulation on the Funds .
By agreeing to this coalition , Mr F@@ ico has left the door open to such out@@ bur@@ sts , and there is a fine line between words and actions .
In 2005 , it was reported from Py@@ ong@@ yang that the country was in possession of nuclear weapons , and the test was carried out at the beginning of this week .
When I r@@ ere@@ ad the Presidency Con@@ clu@@ sions , these seven lines of text read worse now than they did almost a year ago .
I really do want to encourage the Member States to take similar initiatives .
Taking as its basis the guidelines for the EU &apos;s policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers , the European Union is campa@@ ig@@ ning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances , and the declaration of mor@@ at@@ oria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign - albeit not as its main objective , but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practice &apos;s abolition once and for all .
The most important four principles we should try to enhance again at the Pre@@ par@@ atory Committee and then at the next review conference are as follows .
The question is whether all of this should be included in such a Constitution , or if it would be possible to refer to it using different means .
At the same time , however , they are aware that their little country has been abandoned .
The report should focus in particular on the employment structure and the financial situation of fishermen , ship owners and enterprises involved in cod fishing and processing .
All the data , therefore , will in principle be available from that date .
What will this expert report find ?
H@@ und@@ reds of fires broke out simultaneously , everywhere , throughout the day and night , and in all directions .
Solidarity came fully into play through the &apos; European rapid reaction instrument &apos; that we voted for last March , a joint civil protection system in which 30 States make resources such as Can@@ ad@@ airs , tan@@ kers and qualified personnel ( &apos; green ber@@ ets &apos; ) available to countries suffering man @-@ made or natural disasters .
I went to China ; this problem has not caught us by surprise .
I do not know whether this was referred to the Consul@@ tative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Inter@@ institutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codi@@ fication of legislative texts .
Why a closer relationship with Brazil ?

Children are our countries &apos; future , yet EU development funds are rout@@ inely tied to population control programmes aiming at eliminating future Afri@@ cans .
I have concerns regarding any call for a deposi@@ tory passport that would result in the deposi@@ tory being established in a different state from that of the UC@@ ITS .
The EU @-@ Korea Treaty will be the first application of the new EU trade doctrine Global Europe , a doctrine that is highly controversial , not least because it seeks such deep market access conditions through the removal of all kinds of barriers to all @-@ out import penet@@ ration , precisely at a time when more and more people are becoming aware that there are very many lo@@ sers as well as some winners in a completely liber@@ alised global economy .
At the same time , during this period and specifically in these six months , we have seen the European Union taking a lead on policies that affect every European every day : economic growth and job creation , climate change , energy , migration and innovation .
This concerns in particular the matter of emissions reduction in the automotive industry .
I would like to ask you to see to it that the conditions are improved .
To this extent , wai@@ vers in sectors such as iron and steel would be a big mistake .
That said , the texts before us are an exercise in stating the obvious : they reas@@ sert the concept of mutual recognition ; they bow to the man@@ ia for labelling - which is ter@@ med marking - with the CE logo , its approved dimensions and sanctions for its impro@@ per use ; and low and behold , 15 years after the dismantling of borders and customs controls , our rapporteur André Bri@@ e demands more resources for customs officers .
Member of the Commission . - ( RO ) I can only repeat what I have just said , namely that , by the actions taken by the European Commission to support language diversity , not only the 23 official languages are supported , but also the other languages spoken in the European Union , including the regional languages , the less widespread languages .
We also encourage European firms and companies to renew their commitment to Iraq .
In view of the record inflation , a cause of great concern to the European Central Bank , and the economic downturn we are currently witnessing , it seems to me that this is a particularly bad time to increase the excise duty rate on gas oil and fuel oil .
They did not discuss participation in the opening ceremony .
This recognition of the use@@ fulness of volunte@@ ering in both the public and private sphere is essential to its development and to finding the balance between economic , social and the environmental aspects ; i.e. the sustainable development that is at the heart of the European approach .
Consequently , I welcome the initiative to make the problem of poverty more visible and the effort to establish a single coordinated policy .
That originally was the wish of Finland and many other countries .
The first concerns long @-@ term contracts .
Nor are we pleased with the fact that no mention is made of such an important sector as that of combating discrimination , and on this point I would like to know what priority you place on adopting the directive on discrimination .
( BG ) Thank you , Madam President .
This would not simply be a consequence of the economic and financial crisis .
European research has brought about results and it is now both national and regional policy to put these results into practice .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to start by thanking our rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , as he has succeeded in producing a genuinely workable compromise at first reading .
In December 2008 , the European Commission adopted a proposal , tabled by Poland and Sweden , to strengthen the European Union &apos;s cooperation with six of its eastern neighbours .
in writing . - ( EL ) The Greek Communist Party voted against the motion for a resolution on the FY@@ ROM .
It is desirable for consumers to be able to access quality products at reasonable prices , and this thanks to an ambitious policy of financial incentives aimed at this type of agricultural production .
Its responsibility is to provide a concerted , effective and sustained triple response to stimulate demand and the real economy with future investments , to re @-@ establish lending and to promote robust international financial regulation and supervision that provides transparency , stability and appropriate incentives , that elimin@@ ates systemic risks and that ensures that we do not go back to square one .
This is why I am focusing my attention on the need for a separate analysis of the language used on the Internet and its influence on the personal development of the child .
Although they are based on my report , they are not im@@ partial .
Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am shocked at the European Commission &apos;s position on my proposal for pat@@ ernity leave .
This will help us make their accession to the EU a simpler , smo@@ other process .
The new Secretary General of the European Parliament and his colleagues discovered this and implemented measures which will bring annual savings of more than EUR 2 million .
The factories that grew up in their place are outs@@ ourcing work overseas .
Second , offers in terms of financing .
Firstly , what is the relationship between the risks and benefits ?
Fif@@ thly , this calls , in particular , for better and more efficient market surveillance , because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union .
They are seeing their homes demo@@ li@@ shed .
A split vote must be held on this central part , because I do not understand why we are combining these things and not making it clear that we must combat discrimination against religious minorities just as vigorously as all other types of discrimination . It is not acceptable for the measures to combat discrimination against religious minorities to be less strict .
I voted for this regulation because I consider that it is a welcome improvement to a previous measure which restricted the rights of long @-@ stay visa holders in a Member State .
Moreover , the instruments need to be made more flexible , because rigid instruments that cannot adapt to un@@ foreseen circumstances , such as a crisis , are damaging to the European Union &apos;s economic development .
The determination to promote relations with Latin American countries could pa@@ ve the way to resolving the whole issue of European investors &apos; rights , in an appropriate manner .
I am a Portuguese national and at this very moment , the proposal that is being made is to increase taxes .
However , economic success must not be confused with social development , in society as in university ; and so this cross@@ roads we have come to in third @-@ level education , with traditional student @-@ based learning in one direction , and the demands of modern business @-@ driven economies in the other , must be navig@@ ated with the greatest of care .
Unfortunately , I did not have any option other than to vote against this text .
I support the need to reinforce Directive 2000 / 35 / EC and identify instruments necessary to eliminate or reduce late payments in commercial transactions .
Poverty cannot be effectively tackled merely by means of administrative regulations , even those which set minimum incomes .
Universi@@ ties and schools must make a contribution to creating a smart Europe .
The ECR Group is symp@@ a@@ thetic to the dist@@ ress that physical , psychological and or sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability in which it leaves its victims .
I would particularly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , J@@ o Leinen .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
( RO ) Mr President , today , 16 December , we celebrate the 24@@ 0@@ th anniversary of Ludwig van Beetho@@ ven &apos;s birth , the composer of the united Europe &apos;s an@@ them .
In this context , I think that it is important to set up a structure promoting the active involvement of local communities , with a view both to monitoring the agreement &apos;s implementation and improving the forest governance framework and , last but not least , in order to prevent corruption as much as possible .
Dis@@ cus@@ sions took place before that ; they took place outside Parliament , too .
It is on their behalf that I should like to thank Mr Bel@@ et , your rapporteur , for having highlighted important aspects resulting from the need to strengthen health protection measures in the event of the radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ stuffs .
I am pleased that common sense has prev@@ ailed in this case , and that urban and sub@@ urban transport will be protected from excessive regulation .
We have already introduced a test for SMEs which is designed to take into greater account the procedure used in assessing the impact of the various policies and obligations that constra@@ in SMEs .
I welcome the Croatian Government &apos;s efforts to combat various forms of corruption and the reforms of the public administration , and the judiciary being implemented .
This is a waste of money : we should be making savings and introduce a better , credible system of security .
Secondly , the permanent stability mechanism can only be created with security and legal certainty if it is included in the Treaties in a clear way .
The promises of benefits for workers and passengers that always accompany these liberalisation processes are as old and tri@@ te as they are false , as demonstrated by the reality in cases where liberalisation has gone ahead , whether in this sector or in other sectors .
I voted in favour of this report and of the amendment calling for a review of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) .
Number two : keeping under review the possibilities for additional spectrum to meet the growing consumer demand for wireless broadband .
I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate .
That was certainly the case in Northern Ireland , where the European Union played a crucial part through its support for the International Fund for Ireland , and that peace was copper @-@ fast@@ ened last weekend with successful elections .
In view of the ever @-@ increasing importance of CC@@ Is , as well as the objective of strengthening this sector , which is of strategic importance for the achievement of the Europe 2020 goals , the Commission should draw up a White Paper which would un@@ lock cultural and creative potential .
But in this case we were mis@@ led for the simple reason that the rapporteur did not speak on behalf of his committee , but on behalf of his group .
One might be waiting for some very important messages sitting here in the Chamber .
A major weakness of the &apos; old &apos; E@@ MS was that it was up to the Member States involved to initiate the process for adju@@ sting exchange rates .
In that event we should seriously consider having the other four@@ teen summit members simply take decisions without the United Kingdom .
The cooperation of the motor@@ cycling organizations should in our opinion be a central element in making two @-@ whe@@ eled motor vehicles , which from the social point of view are an essential means of transport , ec@@ ologically defen@@ sible and harm@@ less to health as well .
Op@@ enness is one of democracy &apos;s corner@@ stones , and Mr S@@ öder@@ man has sent an inquiry to Union bodies regarding the way in which documents are made available to citizens .
But now things really have gone too far , and this proposal from the Council for a joint action on the right to travel of nationals of non @-@ member countries who are law@@ fully resi@@ ding in a Member State , under Article K@@ .@@ 3 , the third pillar , is an extremely pro@@ voc@@ ative one both for the Commission and for this House .
Why adopt a complicated approach when we can adopt a simple one , easy to understand and clearly stated . I shall therefore be voting for the absolute prohibition of any gift .
The committee is much more open than it used to be .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , unemployment is still a crucial problem in the European Union .
A system of mutual recognition could cause great legal insecurity ; it might be appropriate to advocate a system of prior or de@@ ferred examination , but immediately following registration , thereby reconc@@ iling the requirements of speed in granting the right with legal security and the safeguarding of those most affected by the granting of models .
I shall come back to that later , but firstly I should like to present in greater detail our work programme for next year .
Mr President , two very short final questions .
It would make an important contribution towards credibility and the securing of legitimacy if that further implementation were based on two authori@@ zing orders , as additions to Article 13@@ 8@@ a , for the adoption of a regulatory framework for the legal status , rights and obligations of European political parties , and a corresponding framework for their economics .
Mr President , the delegation of Alle@@ anza Nazi@@ onale hopes that the trust Europe has placed in Croatia , and in Slovenia , will not be betra@@ yed by dish@@ on@@ est behaviour that is quite unacceptable of countries that want to call themselves European and hope to become a part of the European Union .
I think this is a kind of manipulation we cannot accept !
It would be interesting to know what percentage level we are talking about here .
The European Union has no mandate in military matters , has no mandate for defence policy .
That is the path chosen by the Bar@@ th@@ et @-@ Mayer report and that is why our group supports it .
Unfortunately , our financial masters did not back us in their opinion .
The proposal is pure re@@ distribution in the best Socialist style , and I fail to understand what logic moved the rapporteur to put forward this proposal .
So I agree with the question , but I must insist that the European Commission is given the opportunity to define its position .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the House , Mr P@@ ron@@ k &apos;s report follows on from the &quot; growth and employment &apos; initiative which you mentioned , and which Parliament approved by making the necessary resources available during the 1998 budget procedure .
This is the objective of Amendment No 20 which correc@@ ts the original text in this sense .
The debate is closed .
On enlargement and Agenda 2000 I finally wish to say that it is not worth prolon@@ ging the discussion as long as the institutional problems in the EU today remain unresolved .
As the report underlines , no @-@ one is proposing to set the world of the town against the world of the countryside , but we must support a development process which limits the rural deser@@ ti@@ fication process which affects most of the Member States .
Because fle@@ eing our responsibilities is no longer an option .
I would also like to point out that Mrs The@@ ato &apos;s request , made in her capacity as chairman of the Budgetary Control Committee , should give rise to a vote on the request for the Bösch report to be re @-@ entered on the agenda .
In the words of the Jean Fer@@ rat song , women are men &apos;s future .
The debate is closed .
If the ali@@ ens ever do take over they may have the same view of history as it does .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the information society knowledge is a vital resource and information the most important raw material .
But I shall check this information and will let you know immediately if it is correct .
Human rights are now a priority objective in our external relations and our development cooperation .
But the crisis is not always used to make a new beginning .
As regards millennium initiatives we are informed of by operators in the Member States , I have instruc@@ ted my services to make provision for awar@@ ding specific European sponsor@@ ship to projects conve@@ ying the spirit of the construction of Europe .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
I am sorry to labour this point but it is one which has emerged in what is otherwise a rather technical regulation as a point that people can understand and about which many people are worried .
I should like to congratulate Mrs André @-@ Lé@@ on@@ ard very strongly on her excellent report which sets out very comprehen@@ sively the many social and political issues which face India .

Amsterdam does not even require us to deliver an opinion at any point during this procedure .
Hence our proposal that we should not set up another of the famous management committees but , rather , that we should work together with an advisory committee .
Our Committee has worked very quickly and efficiently and , on 28 October 1998 , it unanimously adopted the de Co@@ ene report with 61 amendments .
I want to mention five points in connection with which demands are being made in my part of our report .
The Commission is of the opinion that the common position established by the Council is well @-@ balanced and coherent .
Mr President , I am completely satisfied with the Council &apos; s reply but , before this part of this sitting ends , I would like to ask the Bureau when it intends to decide on the issue , as we are having a debate on Mr von Wogau &apos; s report on the important issue of competition policy and state aid policy , which was meant in fact for this morning , but which today was put back by several hours .
