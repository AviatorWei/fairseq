The debate is closed .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23.@@ 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .
Anyone who would jeopardi@@ se production at this ste@@ el@@ works on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the ste@@ el@@ works itself in jeop@@ ar@@ dy but also one of the region &apos; s employers that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code , the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code .
With regard to your suggestions , Mr Jon@@ ck@@ he@@ er , you already know that my staff , who , although short @-@ handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids &apos; sco@@ re@@ board &apos; .
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement .
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed .
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .
Like the rapporteur , I am pleased with the Commission report , but I did depl@@ ore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .
As an elected representative for the Lo@@ ire @-@ Atlan@@ tique region , unfortunately , I can testi@@ fy to this .
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
Quite clearly it is un@@ desirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or adv@@ ising , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level .
Mr Pur@@ vis has the floor for a procedural motion .
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislat@@ or for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself .
Surely what we should be doing , and I hope you will agree , Commissioner , is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshr@@ ine such big@@ ot@@ ry and prejudice , no matter how sincerely held .
These discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon .
Secondly , as already mentioned by my colleague , Mr Mulder , the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts .
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten , Mr Solana and Mr Mor@@ at@@ inos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions , criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings , economic exploitation of immigrants , and sexual exploitation of woman and children , with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication , notably the Internet , for distributing child pornography .
We accept the pre@@ dominant role of the Council in this , but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .
We need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .
As Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath said , we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revi@@ ve this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic , social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries .
Madam President , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . It is the day of the first debate of European political life .
It would be politically ast@@ ute not to isol@@ ate the Ö@@ VP but to support it as an undeni@@ ably democratic , constitutional and well @-@ known European party , so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that is why we must give the Ö@@ VP our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take !
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler .
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists . I would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .
Whether we want it or not , since Parliament itself is going to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the only spot@@ light capable of sh@@ ed@@ ding a little light on the debates , the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union .
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court .
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First In@@ stance to increase its number of judges , but at the moment , the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned .
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets .
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines .
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , ty@@ res and glass .
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens .
And neither should we create structures which are reli@@ ant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them fore@@ ver@@ more .
But , ladies and gentlemen , if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TA@@ O at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials &apos; jobs needed to do this work , because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep re@@ deplo@@ ying the same staff in@@ definitely , at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre @-@ accession structural instrument ( IS@@ PA ) and in order to ensure that , the Community appropriations for which I am responsible , often in partnership or on terms of co@@ responsibility with Member States , are monitored better , with discipline and transparency .
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .
( Parliament approved the request )
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change , the deple@@ tion of pri@@ me@@ val forests and over@@ fishing , constantly affect our common and vital but , in some ways , un@@ owned resources .
As for the EU &apos; s responsibility , the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broad@@ est sense , of children .
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them , after I have had them translated ? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy , and what is propaganda .
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?
Mrs Schlei@@ cher intim@@ ated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this .
On one point of detail , I would like to thank Mrs C@@ eder@@ schi@@ ö@@ ld for having clarified , for example , the concept of so @-@ called temporary copies in her opinion .
But as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy .
We re@@ focus development policies on poverty reduction strategies .
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights .
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today .
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not sur@@ render its veto .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed .
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations .
In my own country , the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter .
People in the poor countries are beginning to des@@ pair .
So let me state quite clearly here , on behalf of my group , that we discussed at length with Mrs C@@ eder@@ schi@@ ö@@ ld whether it is reasonable to work like this .
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors , which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro .
. ( FR ) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term , I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency .
Mr Prodi talks solely of &apos; mechanisms &apos; and &apos; structures &apos; and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people .
I think that it manages , through a series of clever devices , to carefully avoid addressing the central issue , i.e. the final status of Kosovo .
However , this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restra@@ ining them .
Angola does not enjoy rule of law . It is a repressive dictatorship .
Appar@@ ently , the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so .
We cannot afford to make a mistake , for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance , the firm will know how to tackle it : jobs will be lost , services will be reduced , the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood .
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liber@@ alising the postal services .
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to diver@@ t mail via countries with lower po@@ stage rates .
For he is holding up visions of a well @-@ o@@ iled and effective administration and is , at the same time , drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated .
After all , the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table .
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods .
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a hand@@ ful of cases a year having pe@@ aked at some 80 @-@ 90 cases per year in the early 1990s .
Over @-@ exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent .
Furthermore , this view was accepted in the Commission &apos; s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liqui@@ dation of businesses .
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute , when the disaster is already in progress . Consequently , the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand .
The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers .
Hence we withdraw our signature to Amendment No 4 .
We have therefore voted against the report in its present form , as all the amendments we tabled were rejected . I would like to highlight the following :
However , we do have to introduce something different : we have to find a way of assessing our progress and providing public opinion with tangible facts , and we therefore have to use a bench@@ marking system . By the term bench@@ marking , which was relatively unknown up until a few years ago , I mean a completely institutional means of compar@@ ing and assessing our progress .
Unfortunately , our terminology is night@@ mar@@ ish , but let us genuinely group macroeconomic issues and labour and structural problems together , right now , and we will then be able to achieve the results we desire through very simple , specific measures .
The matter is even harder to appreciate , when we think of how much we are affected by the problems of deser@@ ti@@ fication in North Africa and the problems that are associated with the Mediterranean area .
Concerning the duration of the regulation , our position has been to support an unlimited duration subject to peri@@ odic revision following evalu@@ ations .
He has completely avoided the word &apos; harmonisation &apos; .
Thank you , if there is , in fact , anything to say thank @-@ you for .
Along the same lines , a proper European patent , the development of venture capital and support for young businesses are also of crucial importance .
Co@@ coa and chocolate products
This labelling f@@ ren@@ zy is ad@@ mittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence , but , ladies and gentlemen , if you give up a specific definition of chocolate , then at least do so clearly and openly .
The Union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty .
Can the Commissioner say when an opportunity for re@@ vising the directive to introduce these exceptions - sup@@ posing Parliament would ever agree to them - might arise , and does it feel that such an exception for animal waste and for the burning of empty pesti@@ cide containers in on @-@ farm inciner@@ ators would in fact be likely to gain acceptance ?
Amendments Nos 3 , 16 , 30 and 33 @-@ 35 are not compatible with the directive &apos; s structure and cannot therefore be approved .
It seems to me completely un@@ feasible to go beyond the Gothenburg standard .
The fault lies with those Member States which have failed to observe the directive , and that includes my own .
Even if the European Commission uses its best efforts in the United Kingdom there is no guarantee that the sc@@ roo@@ ge @-@ like United Kingdom Chancellor will find matching funding .
This is what we confirmed in the Commission this afternoon , and Michel Barnier will set out our decisions in a letter to the Member States in a few days .
Commission procedures are under way against nearly every Member State - 12 Member States in fact - under the habit@@ ats directive at the moment .
The new Member States should not only comply with these requirements at the present time .
I quote : &quot; On the one hand , the Central and Eastern European countries are p@@ ill@@ ori@@ ed on account of their policy of structural discrimination etc. and on the other hand , most EU countries are ban@@ ishing the Roma collectively on account of them being economic migrants &quot; .
The Finnish writer Sam@@ uli Par@@ onen wrote : &quot; big crimes need many accompli@@ ces , millions - all those who do nothing &quot; .
But this is not a question of health or environmental protection .
Where reference is made in the current version of 64 / 4@@ 32 to Article 17 , this relates to implementing measures concerning animal health , that is based on Article 37 which are of no or , in very few cases , of very remote , public health concern .
Then we can use the simplified procedure .
These results of the trade negotiations are based on the EU @-@ Mexico agreement to which this Parliament gave the green light on 6 May last year .
Wh@@ ich@@ ever of the two institutional trends implic@@ itly reflected in the debate about the Charter we look at , these groups can take entirely sovereign economic decisions that spell disaster for an entire population , leading , for example , to factories closing down and to the ru@@ in or pollution of an entire region .
As you know , the EU &apos; s international action to promote and protect human rights is based on several instruments , including the CFSP and development cooperation .
The debate is closed .
We are addressing them to try to preserve species under renewed threat , species like the Asian pan@@ go@@ lin , the gor@@ ill@@ as of the Congo , the el@@ ep@@ han@@ ts - through the sale of i@@ vor@@ y - and the other species mentioned in the resolution .
It is , therefore , also important to make it clear that the subsidy arrangements ensure that consumers obtain food at prices which , as a result of the subsidy , are lower than they would be without the subsidy .
But if Member States are in a position to do that earlier , so be it and so much the better .
There is a multi @-@ lay@@ ered response , there are many issues involved , and I have indicated a number of them to you this afternoon .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr Hat@@ zi@@ dak@@ is asked me who we are negotiating with and Mrs Jackson reminded us of the meeting they have had with Mr S@@ later , the Secretary of State for Transport .
Only if there is in agreement on the other aspects would I come to Parliament to ask for your support for a postp@@ on@@ ement with regard to third country airlines , for a suspension of the provision of the regulation in this specific respect .
Without a decisive programme for basic structural reforms , which improve the ability of European business to compete , the digital era will be a time of frustration for Europe , hence our amendment designed to remind us of this fact which is so obvious and yet so worrying .
We keep being told that Berlin is set in concrete .
Mr President , it takes some ner@@ ve to state that employment is , and I quote , a constant priority of the European institutions at a time when the European Union has 18 million unemployed and when , at this very moment , a number of the most wealthy of all major European businesses are announ@@ cing sav@@ age job cuts without the said institutions lifting a finger to prevent them .
The second point is that we tend to polar@@ ise , and that causes problems .
This is a complex assembly of measures which have only been tim@@ i@@ dly , bel@@ at@@ edly and in part announced by the Council and the Commission .
The European Union has a duty to be extremely vigilant about imports of agricultural products which threaten to imper@@ il the whole of European production .
Europe can be the peace intermedi@@ ary to bring such a peaceful solution to the island of Sri Lanka and peace for the Tam@@ il and Sin@@ hal@@ ese communities and others in Sri Lanka .
All the same , the Internet is not beyond the law .
The Internet makes ex@@ changing pictures easier , and it is this we should be discussing .
In Denmark alone , the level of aid is EUR 2 billion per year so that the present little fund is of absolutely no effect .
This substance is no luxury and it is not addic@@ tive .
I am very concerned indeed about the reference that the President made as to who would be present from the Council when the President of Austria atten@@ ds this Parliament tomorrow .
The conditional postp@@ on@@ ement of the discharge suggested by Mrs Sta@@ uner is to be welcomed .
We must also make sure that we find a mechanism within this system to make sure that we take account not only of the reports that are submitted by members of the Budgetary Control Committee , but also those by members of other parliamentary committees .
I also think it is a good idea to look a little more closely at the discharge for the development fund .
Its importance is evident in the fact that in many cases it is now being proposed that the discharge should be postponed .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.@@ 45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
The Fund is to establish a financial re@@ distribution system in order to balance out the financial expenses incurred by Member States in receiving refugees and to enable those with the least developed systems to bring them up to speed .
So when I read the summit conclusions which state that Europe has set itself the goal of promoting a dynamic knowledge @-@ based economy &apos; capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs &apos; , I say , &apos; Go on then , I dare you . &apos;
Where do you expect to get if you do not know where exactly you are heading ?
Africa asked Europe for more market access and debt re@@ payment , and got vague ple@@ dges in return .
The document is also signed by countries where human rights are being violated on a massive scale , where women are discrimin@@ ated against , where the little funding that is available is used to mass@@ acre other population groups and where corruption has taken on almost iner@@ a@@ dic@@ able proportions .
But rapid reaction facility action is not meant to last longer than absolutely necessary .
We will keep in touch with them .
Subject : Structural measures to overcome delays in payments The EU budget is failing in that commitment author@@ is@@ ations are not being adequately matched by payments .
This is unacceptable in my view .
This also shows how weak the democratic basis of such a Parliament would be .
The time has come to make those who engage in the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms legally responsible for damage to human health and the environment .
Second number : two thirds .
Because of the front @-@ loading of our commitments in Kosovo , next year we will need to spend about EUR 800@@ m in the Balkans .
They are thus parallel processes , with liberalisation on one side and consumer protection on the other , and these are the two objectives which you will find wherever financial markets are at issue .
The World Trade Organisation condemned the system of licences in force , which must undoubtedly be modified .
- ( EL ) The citizens of Europe , especially workers , farmers , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , women , the young , the nou@@ ve@@ aux pau@@ v@@ res , all those who suffer under the policies of the EU , are already vo@@ icing their anger and disagreement , some more for@@ ce@@ fully than others , with the choices being made by the European Union .
The Council of Europe , in its report Coh@@ er@@ ent and Integrated Family Poli@@ cies , states , &quot; Famili@@ es play a primary role in soci@@ alisation because they communicate the values , standards , customs and behaviour of the social groups to which their children belong &quot; .
We have a slogan in German which says &apos; Mil@@ k che@@ ers up tired chap@@ s &apos; .
I am in total agreement with Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba i Böh@@ m when he says that we must integrate this regional dimension into our information policy and , when I discuss the issue with the competent national politicians , I will ensure that this is taken into account .
I do not know whether we will be able to include an item in the agenda for this part @-@ session to the effect that we should be provided with information on the state of the euro , which is a cause for concern , or whether we should endeavour here and now to ensure that the issue is included in the agenda for the next Strasbourg part @-@ session .
Our committee proposes a four @-@ sided agreement between the three states concerned and the Union .
At present , one in three flights is delayed and 450 000 flight hours are lost annually , and unless far @-@ reaching measures are taken , the situation will only get worse .
Furthermore , by approving this directive , Parliament will be taking a decisive step in favour of the competitiveness of European businesses in the &apos; on line &apos; economy and will be setting a milestone so that both consumers and companies will be able to operate in the internal market with the same guarantees and the same ease with which they operate in their domestic markets .
We should not forget that the Internet is international .
He has called for an extension of that programme by one year , although Mr Ho@@ witt has already pointed out that , in actual fact , we are already half@@ way through that year .
T@@ onight I will con@@ fine myself solely to the question of freedom of movement and will specifically address the subject of cross @-@ border workers .
I am sure that the assent of the European Parliament will be very helpful in this respect in encouraging people in Switzerland to vote on May 21 in what we all think would be the right way .
I do not share the opinion expressed in Amendment No 8 , since I think that con@@ fis@@ c@@ ating illegally copied goods , even if it is only a simple compact disc , may well serve as an example and be of instruc@@ tional value , particularly with regard to young people , who must learn that copying is damaging to the artist whose works they like .
Thank you , Mr Barón Crespo .
Am I not right in thinking that sugar fell outside the scope of the Berlin agreements ?
We have the following comments to make on the issues addressed in the report : as regards cereals , we disagree with the reduction in the monthly incre@@ ments of the intervention price , which should have been increased .
But that has nothing to do with adjustments to the amounts .
Conver@@ sely , those who have something to lose wall themselves in and for their own security hire those who previously had professional roles in the army and the police .
There is no point in the President of our Parliament just putting her mark at the bottom of the page .
The text which I have proposed is in line with the original proposal of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Clearly one reason for this is that the Commission is obviously proving to be too in@@ flexible , despite the fact that , on paper , it has transferred full powers to the director of OLAF in a decision in due and proper form .
It is not practic@@ able to collect , inciner@@ ate and carry out a full epide@@ mi@@ ological investigation on each fallen animal .
As an example , I refer here to the decisions made by the French Government on working hours .
On one point , there is a need for nostal@@ gia : we want to maintain a small part of the history of Europe and keep historic railway lines in their original state .
The Council should accept our opinion and the Commission should support us , not the Council , Commissioner .
In any event , I would say to those who are concerned about this issue that the quantitative and qualitative assessment of full employment will become more efficient when we implement the indicators relating to the different policies .
If there are specific problems , then the two @-@ year period may be extended for a further year , but the Member State must incorporate the procedure in full .
I would like to remind this House that the protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam of the EU recognises that the system of public broadcasting within Member States of the EU is directly related to the democratic , social and cultural needs of our society .
There are few people in the rab@@ ble we have seen inv@@ ading farms who could afford the employees , the machinery , seeds and fertili@@ sers to farm these units to give a potential export output .
They offer un@@ bund@@ led access to the local loop , facilitating developments in licensing , co @-@ location , carrier pre @-@ selection and the independence and the powers of national regulatory authorities .
But a European research area can only be created if , in addition to an advanced infrastructure , we also have a European identity and European creativity .
These are the laws of the global community .
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is perhaps the first step in this direction .
... because , Madam President , a majority in the Legal Affairs Committee considered , on purely legal bases , that we could not take note of this loss of MEP status .
The budget line suggested by the Court of Auditors for European parties is really not necessary .
This will not be easy .
As the House knows , I - as the Commissioner responsible - presented an anti @-@ discrimination package a few months ago , containing two directives and a programme .
Football : &quot; Euro 2000 &quot; and preventing ho@@ oli@@ gan@@ ism - B5 @-@ 04@@ 62 / 2000 by Stock@@ ton , He@@ aton @-@ Harris and Perry , on behalf of the PPE DE Group
We also ask you to take a hard economic line against Burma .
Only in this way can trafficking in women be effectively pushed back .
The Commission is now actively participating in the work on the draft United Nations protocol on trafficking to supplement the draft convention on trans @-@ national organised crime and I sincerely hope that the members of the United Nations will be able to adopt this new convention in autumn this year .
I have already answered the first question , Mr Dau@@ l , since I told you that the checks would also be carried out in Brussels as well as in Luxembourg where many people work , and this must not be overlooked .
Madam President , I rise under Rule 126 ( 3 ) so that I might question whether a qu@@ or@@ um exists for this vote .
I would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out .
There is an obvious gap in the Rules of Procedure in this respect .
The tobacco industry presents itself as the har@@ b@@ inger of employment in Europe and claims to defend jobs , but what has the management in the tobacco industry actually achieved between the late 1980s and the present ?
People inhal@@ e more if they have a light cigarette than any other cigarette .
In 1973 a co@@ b@@ alt 60 source was lost in the North Sea , never to be found again .
Like Mrs Gr@@ ô@@ ss@@ et@@ ete , I think it is important that we establish the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle and , in this regard , I can support the rapporteur , as well as Mrs Gr@@ ô@@ ss@@ et@@ ete &apos; s amendment .
Under these circumstances , it is ide@@ alistic to believe that measures to strengthen competition further will prevent the market from being control by a hand@@ ful of monopolies .
I ask him to direct his attention to that .
Question No 37 by ( H @-@ 04@@ 67 / 00 ) :
Last year , all Member States agreed to back the second European alcohol action plan drafted by the WHO .
These derogations from fundamental principles of the internal market have been granted in order to allow Sweden to adapt its alcohol policy .
I am sure the honourable member agrees that it makes sense to wait for the results of this discussion before tabling the matter before plenary .
This is not just a question of money .
While smoking causes suffering and illnesses even among people who do not smoke , especially among people with all@@ ergies , it is only the s@@ nu@@ ff ta@@ ker himself who is exposed to possible ill effects .
Mr President , I thank the Commission , the presidency and all my fellow deleg@@ ates for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed and which has greatly imp@@ acted on the conference .
China &apos;s accession to WTO
The House will know that , in exemplary fashion , Commissioner Lamy has held several rounds of discussions with Members of this Parliament during the final phases of the negotiations with China .
For that reason , an informal dialogue free from the exact wording of the basic agreement , which the Commissioner mentioned in his speech , is more crucial than ever before .
It would be politically more responsible at this time to try and reduce the tensions . We must therefore particularly support the efforts which the authorities of the two countries have been making , especially through their respective Foreign Ministers , in order to prevent certain incidents from being exploited , for the sake of the overall situation which is itself of considerable significance and whose resolution may be vital to ensure the balance of the geographical area concerned .
As the Commission has said , the consequences of Mit@@ ch will considerably reduce the results of the efforts towards economic recovery and investment made there during the last decade by the European Union .
The Community action plan is a chance to combine the reconstruction process with an element of change - change which these countries genuinely need - and to invest in a new economic and social development process based on the priorities of health , education and high quality services , which , in these countries , are directly responsible for the quality of life , and , above all , the quality of their democracy .
For example , with regard to access to the labour market . However , a fellow member in your group , if I remember correctly , our new Home Secretary , expressed a similar thought once .
He is unable to secure any compensation or , indeed , any justice for the injuries he has suffered .
In my opinion , the forecast , as it was established at the end of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament , is precise and essentially correct .
It really is absolutely unacceptable .
In our opinion , public opinion is at its lowest eb@@ b now when it comes to the formation of military institutions for the European Union .
I , myself , have tabled a technical amendment , the third amendment , which correc@@ ts a trans@@ cription error likely to cause confusion and make paragraph 28 in@@ consistent with the rest of the report .
It is also important to give these signals , because otherwise the opposition feels isolated and loses all its drive .
The resolution before us simply pays tribute to the initiative used by another Southern C@@ one country to arrest the leader of a military coup d &apos; é@@ tat and ex@@ tradi@@ te him to his country of origin .
Fortunately , by the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s nearly every Latin American state had returned to democracy .
For example , we were discussing Parag@@ u@@ ay just a few minutes ago .
Mr President , I voted for the Mar@@ set Cam@@ pos report and I will tell you why , although I would first like to express my support for Mr Sper@@ oni &apos; s speech .
In terms of managing the CAP , this will finally create a management infrastructure with the technical basis to transform a policy which until now has ir@@ ra@@ tionally subsi@@ dis@@ ed the richest countries , regions and farmers and encouraged surpluses and environmental damage . The new system is geographi@@ cally oriented , it will encourage sustainable agriculture and it will assist the regions and rural communities which are most in need .
Mr Cas@@ aca &apos; s report covers this to a considerable extent .
These are two aspects of a fascinating world , which clearly requires protection , but also requires flexibility .
Prec@@ eding the down@@ fall of the Roman Empire it was custom@@ ary to take out the imperial decre@@ e , un@@ roll the great sc@@ roll of pur@@ ple and gold , read it , have it copied and distribute it - and nobody took the sligh@@ test notice of it .
The European Council on 19 and 20 June was a very valuable meeting of important consolidation .
Our citizens expect no less than that , and we must live up to their expectations .
Pre@@ dict@@ ably , the main themes , ranging from enlargement to the CI@@ G , via the Charter of Fundamental Rights , were largely put off for the Nice Summit .
An agreement that is not easy to conclude is not a perfect agreement , but it is a necessary compromise .
Firstly , can the Commission confirm whether Mr Fl@@ é@@ ch@@ ard is related in any way to Mr Delors and / or members of his cabinet ?
It is only by being united and , at the same time , retaining our own identities that we will be able to survive and , in this context , we must not be a fortress but we must , nevertheless , combine our forces and our efforts .
Mr President , my speaking time is too restricted to describe the fate of a country for which , for so many years , the situation was in fact quite hop@@ eful , but which for the past couple of years has been on a sli@@ pper@@ y slope towards greater under@@ development , whilst the population of Zimbabwe is highly developed . This is probably one of the things we should give the Mugabe government credit for during its early years .
More specific action could be also be undertaken with regard to developing awareness @-@ raising campaigns on the real possibilities of legal immigration and on all forms of trafficking , as well as increasing the ability of the authorities in the countries of origin or transit to effectively combat this type of crime themselves .
In an increasingly glob@@ alised world , the Union must increase its presence in these organisations which regulate offshore fishing , for reasons of prestige , good management of resources and , above all , the defence of the interests of our industry and our workers .
It is a very balanced piece of work covering quite a wide range of views .
Mr President , I do not have time to expand further .
This is necessary for the long @-@ term survival of the European railway sector and all Member States would be in agreement with this goal .
It advocates wage restraint , flexibility and job insecurity .
It would also have been a good thing for this Parliament if it had had the courage to recognise in this particular report that the present weakness in the single European currency is chie@@ fly due to a lack of economic flexibility . Nevertheless , I am glad that at least some reservations have been voiced about certain decisions taken recently in the euro countries , for example on working hours , which instead of making the labour market flexible have made it rigid , and are also contributing to the euro &apos; s weakness .
After all , the hall@@ mark of sound information is that it is tailored to the specific circumstances of those involved , and people and companies have a great deal more faith in their own associations and organisations than they do in public institutions .
Mr President , the question troub@@ ling me over Mr Karas &apos; report is whether we are actually asked to endorse an information campaign on the practical implications of the introduction of the euro , or a propaganda campaign in favour of it .
When the Council and the Commission start taking environmental policy seriously , the budgetary line which they propose in the general budget will be comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate with the challenges we have to face .
I would have liked to have seen all Members being treated equally and no one having more or less rights - that should have been the starting point !
However , I would particularly like to explain why I supported the proposals for amendments tabled by Mr Vir@@ ran@@ ko@@ ski and Mr Mulder .
We therefore need to sub@@ tract EUR 2.3 billion from the 5.@@ 5 billion announced by Mr Prodi for the reconstruction of the Balkans from 2000 @-@ 2006 .
Tra@@ des@@ men and tra@@ des@@ men &apos;s organisations have informed me that staff in shops have neither the time nor the knowledge to answer all the questions that customers are going to ask .
Anyone who did go to the trouble of observing their children would quickly discover , as has already been said a number of times , that children su@@ ck away at anything they get their hands on , and not only on things that are intended to be put into their mou@@ ths .
If we want our internal market really to be a domestic market for companies and consumers , the current fragmentation suffered by patents , resulting from national borders , makes no sense .
P@@ illar II issues have to be addressed to the Member States but , given our related responsibilities under P@@ illar I , we take an interest .
We set fires for ecological reasons . In the Nordic forests , there are a great many species of plant which have wa@@ xed seeds .
Cultural and linguistic diversity are mat@@ ch@@ less assets but sadly often stand in the way of widespread distribution .
So you see , I am forced to tell you that your proposals - though not excessive , Mrs Hier@@ ony@@ mi - cannot be supported by the Commission .
The more oriented it is towards the information society , the more open it has to be , and the more civili@@ sed it is the more public it must be .
I regard the broad line of separ@@ ating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one .
Despite which , there is clearly a huge problem here .
This report was over@@ due and limited almost exclusively to dealing with legal and technical transposition .
The existing rules make for great flexibility , and most countries guarantee women better conditions than the common regulations require .
This is why I wholeheartedly supported this common position as it stood and did not vote for any amendments .
I maintain my position and I now suggest that we move straight on to the debate on Fi@@ ji and the Sol@@ om@@ on islands , as that is what our fellow Members are waiting for .
I believe that Hai@@ der is , and we must recognise this , expressing his cont@@ empt for the sanctions that the European Union is currently imposing on him as it was when the Portuguese Presidency took the initiative of proposing the nomination of three wise men that he decided to re@@ tali@@ ate by demanding a referendum on lifting sanctions , a completely dema@@ go@@ gic , populist and anti @-@ European referendum .
Since it is true that effective cooperation is required and since technical and disciplinary measures are essential in this area , we do not support these guidelines , which are even more radically in favour of liberalisation than those suggested by the Commission .
However , after five years , it has become clear that short shipping is still merely an empty promise which has not been kept , despite the verb@@ al support by the Transport Council of 8 December 1999 , which considered short sea shipping as a priority .
Mr President , I would first like to congratulate the Danish Government on taking the initiative to propose the Council framework decision that we are discussing , which aims to equi@@ p us with more effective tools for combating serious environmental crime .
It is obvious that the director of a company will take a more serious view of the environment , as it is possible that he will end up isolated from it as a result of having gone to prison for crimin@@ ally ab@@ using it .
I am sure that he will want to respond fully and rapidly to the concerns which have just been raised .
MEDA
The second idea which was restored was the har@@ ness@@ ing of financial resources that were adequate to the challenges .
Those who wish to do that have other debates , in the field of institutional reform , in which to find expression for their aspirations .
I watch in silence and amaz@@ ement and I am reminded that the real Sal@@ adi@@ n made a sol@@ em@@ n pledge to the Ara@@ bs never to make a pact with non @-@ belie@@ vers .
He would kill them en masse and throw them into the sea .
Finally , despite the uncertainty hanging over the future of the peace process in the Middle East , which we have just debated , developing our Euro @-@ Mediterranean relations is one of the French Presidency &apos; s main concerns .
I wish to conclude this overview of the various categories of expenditure with the expenditure on pre @-@ accession aid .
According to the information available , the fir@@ ing was carried out by a small group of people allegedly wishing to prevent the Albanian policy carrying out arre@@ sts in their village .
Transpar@@ ency requires this , and I believe that the recent texts issued by the Commission contribute to making these principles understandable , clear and transparent to all .
When the plane arrived at Frankfurt airport , it was immediately surrounded by German police .
I have inher@@ ited this particular cor@@ nu@@ cop@@ ia as chairman of the committee because Mrs Kl@@ amt felt at the end of the votes at committee stage that she could no longer support the text as it stood and therefore I am presenting it to the House today .
I believe we should be highlighting the fact that , in the final analysis , it is unemployment and in@@ secure employment that should be banned and not the right of immigrants to live with their families only if they can provide evidence of adequate means and a roof over their head .
I believe that an identity card for pensioners and the use of computers should replace these cum@@ ber@@ some forms of author@@ ising payments .
The right to vote must be extended to non @-@ Community nationals if we want to get rid of xenophobia and racism in Europe .
We are currently working on this .
Mr President , the report by Mr Bou@@ w@@ man , which is the outcome of a long process , has in the interim become even more topical in France because of the ship@@ w@@ reck of the tan@@ ker , the Erika , on the occasion of which the Minister for the Environment did not see fit to inter@@ rupt his holiday .
Bou@@ medi@@ ene @-@ Th@@ ier@@ y report ( A5 @-@ 020@@ 7 / 2000 )
With regard to the second section , there are many problems in the way Directive 64 / 2@@ 21 / EEC has been implemented .
The comments you made , Mr Verheugen , prov@@ oked amaz@@ ement , irrit@@ ation and also anger amongst the Socialist Group .
The difference obviously does not depend on which government is in power .
Question Time ( Commission )
It is something I am concerned about and am seeking to address by making sure that there are clear guidelines , as you suggest , so you and I are fully in agreement on that point .
Is the Commission prepared to acknowledge that , in view of the special session , a Communication on children &apos;s rights is of the utmost importance ?
Establi@@ shing controls at the external borders and , temporarily , at the internal borders of the Schengen area is not the same as closing a border or systematically turning away people who wish to enter the territory in order to attend a football match .
I wonder if the Commissioner can confirm that , once Sweden has entered into the Schengen Agreement , the latter &apos; s regulations will , in the future too , require Swe@@ des to have their pas@@ sports with them when they travel to other countries within the Schengen area .
Question No 50 will be replied to in writing .
Secondly , training must be geared towards the choices made by a country in a service and information society . In other words , the fields covered by training must be linked to the choices made by the country .
Thank you very much , Mr Fischler , for your replies .
The Commission has been quick to say that , in the future , all costs are to be borne by the manufacturer .
Thirdly , incentives to abuse the system must be reduced .
The central committee has stated several times that it can no longer guarantee the py@@ ra@@ mid structure on the basis of which sporting organisations and the social function of sport are currently organised .
Mr De Ro@@ o was right in demonstrating that the regulation proposed by the Commission will not sufficiently improve matters , and that it is technically possible to reduce pollution by a few deci@@ bels .
Man@@ kind moves , and moves other objects .
This sm@@ acks of contradiction .
For this reason alone , aviation can win the unfair competitive battle against the railways , which have lost a large part of their share of international passenger transport to other modes of long @-@ distance travel , especially aviation .
But unfortunately , the enjoyment we derive from sport has come under pressure over the past decades and has been mar@@ red by a persistent and one @-@ sided focus on performance and ever greater commercial interests .
Indeed , the question arises as to whether Mand@@ ela has not analysed the Burundi conflict too much from his own South African context .
A strategy paper is being prepared by the Commission to support the peace agreement implementation concentrating on demo@@ bili@@ sation , social and economic reconstruction of Burundi and state reform .
The debate is closed .
And thirdly , the European Union must demand that President Past@@ ran@@ a puts an end to all violations of human rights by paramilit@@ ary groups in his country , and that the sad world records of thousands of victims that are reached each year should come to an end .
That ten@@ et is now only half the truth , however , and it cannot remain so , for the processes of change and transformation in society , in the world of work and in the environment are by no means over after school or after training , but continue and become still more marked .
Madam President , a fellow honourable Member has just drawn attention to an anti @-@ Sem@@ i@@ tic incident .
The issue of racism was heavily debated in Germany over the summer , and I would now like to tell you about several extremely disturbing incidents that have taken place there since the last part @-@ session , in order to raise awareness of what is going on .
According to the ECB , monetary policy cannot remedy this situation in the short term .
We must lower our dependency on imported petro@@ le@@ um products .
The great Conservative British stat@@ es@@ man Benjamin Dis@@ ra@@ eli was one of the pione@@ ers of health and safety regulations .
Amendment 14 , paragraph 4.@@ 2.2 , for example , reads as follows : &apos; Before portable lad@@ ders are brought into service , their feet shall be prevented from sli@@ pping by securing the sti@@ les at or near their upper or lower ends , by any anti @-@ slip device or by any other arrangement of equivalent effectiveness .
I have said in other interventions that , in my opinion , it is not only necessary but also takes us in the right direction .
Our block exemption regulations and notic@@ es will give companies more certainty on the contents of our rules and in self @-@ assessing their agreements in the spirit of an overall modernisation effort .
The problem I am referring to is the notable lack of harmony and coordination in development cooperation action and policy between the European Union and its Member States , on the one hand , and between some of the Member States themselves , on the other .
It can lead to lower prices for them .
The statements of those j@@ ok@@ ers who persist , year in , year out , in asser@@ ting to the contrary , are pure fabri@@ cation .
If , today , it is respected by this kind of civilisation and way of thinking , then , tomorrow , it will safeguard that of future generations .
The French Finance Minister , responsible for implementing the withdrawal of the fran@@ c , recently published on his website a very interesting survey on the French people &apos; s commitment to their currency .
I believe we should make more funds available to those people , but in terms of human rights , we are still waiting for responses from the Commission with regard to Par@@ agra@@ phs 29 and 35 .
On the other hand , feedback information from small and medium @-@ sized enterprises concerning a given year is only available for all the instruments in the last quarter of the following year .
We must not , however , have harmonisation for harmonisation &apos; s sake and , in other areas , the Member States &apos; criminal law and administration of justice are national concerns .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten on her excellent report on the situation of frontier workers and , in particular , the social and fiscal problems these workers face .
The very strength of the habit@@ ats directive lies in its flexibility .
The current un@@ favourable economic climate for farming in general and young farmers in particular , the obvious lack of prospects for young farmers , the decline in the number of full @-@ time farmers and the consequ@@ ent ageing of those who remain - these are all general trends which underline the problem .
There is currently a ban on exporting hazardous waste , including to third countries , that is to say non @-@ EU countries .
By the end of 2000 there were approximately 500 000 refugees in camps in Western Tanz@@ ania of whom around 360 000 were Bur@@ un@@ di@@ ans , 110 000 Con@@ gol@@ ese and the remainder Rwand@@ ans , Som@@ alis and other nation@@ alities .
Commissioner , I think it only fair to thank you for such an exhaus@@ tive answer , which to a certain extent reas@@ sures me . To the same extent as you are reas@@ su@@ red , I think , because there is no doubt that the problems of these numerous refugees in Tanz@@ ania are severe .
The report , therefore , expresses views on the four aspects of the common fisheries policy , which are conservation and management of resources , structural policy , market organisation and relations with third countries .
We must not sh@@ y away from it .
In order to obtain all possible re@@ assurance from the world of science , we call upon the Council and the Commission to take an active part in this coordination operation and exchange of information and we urge the Commission to set in motion its own autonomous scientific enquiry .
Allow me just briefly to mention the three most important of these strategies .
This concept , for some sort of European gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , has far @-@ reaching implications and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion .
Some people do not consider that to be a human right , but I believe in fact that it is and represents another step forward that we should welcome .
As there is no strategy , tactics then become the strategy .
During a first stage , parallel to the discussion begun under the Swedish Presidency , at the invitation of the European Council and in fact as early as possible there should be a discussion and opinion @-@ forming process at the level of the national parliaments , which would then , just like the European Parliament , have to submit a proposal by , say , Spring 2002 on this distribution of powers .
We would like our regions to be able to engage in direct dialogue , so as to remove the dispar@@ ity in employment levels that can exist between different regions and one Member State .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this debate has made it very clear that the majority of Members of the European Parliament is disappointed by the outcome of Nice .
Partic@@ ular emphasis was placed on the exchange of information between authorities and organisations working on issues concerning trafficking in human beings and illegal migration .
In any event , of the relevant amendments , the Commission accepts the spirit of Amendments Nos 12 , 13 and 17 , but with a different wording .
Could you please talk to the powers @-@ that @-@ be and put extra flights back to Brussels on Thursday evening to accommodate our staff , so that they can stay here all Thursday .
In my own country , Ireland , there are 129 persons per million inhabitants killed on the roads each year .
We shall not oppose administrative measures to improve the participation of women in the decision @-@ making process , provided that they are accompanied by the corresponding grass @-@ roots policy and can therefore effectively remove barriers to the participation of women .
However , we have noticed - even recently - that people who have played and who still play an important role in European developments , such as former chan@@ cell@@ ors Koh@@ l and Schmidt , tend to be in favour of Turkey &apos;s European prospects when they are talking as politicians but , when speaking at private seminars and conferences , maintain that Turkey has no place in the European Union .
The next item is the joint debate on :
Similarly , with regard to immigration , I would argue that it is in both our and their interest to fight illegal immigration and therefore establish a European @-@ scale policy .
We have asked Israel to end immediately the with@@ holding of revenue payments due to the Palestinian Authority and we have reacted promptly to the crisis by addressing both the humanitarian situation and the precarious budgetary situation of the Palestinian Authority .
The Commission will equally act on the opinion that such ru@@ min@@ ant f@@ ats should only be s@@ our@@ ced from dis@@ crete adi@@ pose tissu@@ es when fed as milk replac@@ ers to cal@@ ves .
The financial shortcomings , on the other hand , are clear , both at Community and national level .
How do the Commission and the Council deal with this ?
Wiel@@ and report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 12 / 2001 )
Many workers from these Mediterranean countries move around Europe and it seems only fair to me that they should have access to the benefits of a single pension .
If at any time the dis@@ cards exceed part of that closure , then the fishermen will quite readily accept .
( DE ) Mr President , it is your job to chair the debate , not proc@@ laim your aston@@ ishment .
We are sure that Mr Hat@@ zi@@ dak@@ is will make it possible . &quot;
I wish to thank Mrs Palacio for her support throughout the history of this proposal .
This position is not changed by the clear improvements due to Directive 90 / 220 and which we are now discussing .
Should it be directed at the fact that some millions of euros which should have gone in aid have disappeared and that taxpayers &apos; money has been mis@@ managed ; or should it be directed against those who express their disappointment at the fact that these issues have not been successfully clarified ?
Mr President , this question , as Mr Harbour will be aware , has direct relevance to the question raised by Mrs The@@ or@@ in because we believe that amongst the many other justi@@ fications for making changes , as regards app@@ rais@@ al and the advance towards a more linear career structure , will be to give fairer treatment to women officials , and indeed to make the Commission more attractive for the employment of women , particularly women who have family obligations .
This proposal was accepted by the Stand@@ ing Veter@@ inary Committee and , when it is formally adopted , Member States will be required to ensure removal of the ver@@ te@@ b@@ ral column .
It will provide an appropriate answer to the necessity of making both private and public sectors aware of their responsibilities towards our environment on which their activities have an impact .
We do not think so .
&apos;@@ Ac@@ ci@@ dents &apos; or &apos; surprises &apos; have already been recorded in specific cases of this sort of genetic manipulation in the USA , Australia and elsewhere .
Jobs , jobs , jobs .
You are not representatives of either the State or the Government but of the electoral district that elected you , which coinci@@ des with the Kingdom of Spain ; this is your official title .
I would like just briefly to follow up one aspect , which I do not think you really touched on .
Refer@@ ring to what Mr Kir@@ k@@ hope said , this is an issue of great importance and I could not agree with him more .
With regard to this document , drawn up by Mrs Pei@@ js , which concerns a directive on the re@@ organisation and winding @-@ up of insurance undertakings , I have to say that Mrs Pei@@ js is certainly - as always - attentive to financial issues .
Its starting prem@@ ise is the protection and expansion of production and the creation of the financial pre@@ conditions for that .
Mr President , I did not dream about the Iz@@ qui@@ erdo Ro@@ jo document , which provides for aid to the producers of certain agricultural products , including ha@@ zel@@ nuts .
After rejecting this report , we now hope that the Stockholm Council , in March , will bring the Commission back into line .
I currently hold passport and other details for a constitu@@ ent of mine , a Pakist@@ ani citizen , who has had to travel there for family reasons and in the past has had difficulty leaving that country , even under the previous regime .
In fact , in this matter , we are suffering from a lack of Europe rather than an excess of Europe , and it is the smaller countries that are taking the ra@@ p for this defici@@ ency !
The four and a half months that we have set aside for those negotiations and consultation allow us to work quickly but thoroughly .
At the beginning of this sitting Madam President spoke about &quot; la liste in@@ sup@@ portable d &apos; att@@ ent@@ ats &quot; and I agree with her .
That does not arise in this instance , but I am satisfied that in the event that there is evidence of criminal activity - and I am sure you are referring to the UK when you asked me this question Mr C@@ ush@@ nah@@ an - that the UK authorities will be well aware of the fact that prosec@@ utions of this type are appropriate in the circumstances .
This House &apos; s objective is to encourage inc@@ umb@@ ents to continue to be major players , yet there is a danger that their over @-@ domin@@ ance will discrimin@@ ate against new entran@@ ts , when one of our key priorities is to create a climate in which new entran@@ ts are allowed to flour@@ ish .
I would also like to thank the Chairman of the committee and all the group coordin@@ ators , and all the Members who have contributed to the preparation of this report , taking up , with great sensitivity , my invitation to make this report a document which comp@@ els broad consensus and a broad majority in Parliament , reflecting all the positions expressed by the European Parliament .
Although this is a traditional demand by a political group in this House which has always been rejected , to propose it when another more than controversial protocol has just been concluded , in which the shi@@ po@@ wn@@ ers involved not only do not pay the 25 % which is paid in this case , but pay absolutely nothing , is particularly offensive .
I also drew this conclusion from a recent hearing on Iraq before our Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy .
( The House rose and observed a minute &apos; s silence )
In other words , these processes are quite normal ; they are certainly not unusual .
In my opinion , this is the key point in this proposal .
The sector &apos;s stakeholders , the sugar be@@ et producers as well as the sugar manufacturers , need to be able to look far enough ahead to make appropriate investment decisions .
Well then , the issue of communication - as you see , Commissioner , this is not a piece of make @-@ believe but something which is inn@@ ate in the nature of the relationship between the institutions and the citizens and in the will to build a Europe of the citizens as well as an institutional Europe - is closely linked to a strategy , to a genuine communication project which , I regret to have to say , on behalf of the Committee , is lacking , despite the numerous debates which I have called for and which have taken place in committee and , quite frankly , despite the appeals made by all the groups to Commissioner Reding and President Prodi .
Since the agenda is extremely full , the only way to include this point without having to remove something else would be to cut short Question Time .
The first question is therefore how to understand and show solidarity , so that we can assist these people and make their terrible situation less bur@@ den@@ some .
Individual Member States and individual legal systems cannot be given the discretion to examine visa applications .
On the question of financing , for example , the share financed from the Community is not to exceed 70 % of the total cost .
In my view - and , furthermore , I intend , during the Belgian Presidency , to present a proposal on this issue to the Ministers for Sport - these measures could be extended to cover other sports , because the protection of young people concerns all other sports as well as football , and the same goes for solidarity between the clubs in the premier division and the small clubs who put in the initial work .
They have raised this concern on a number of occasions yet they continue to be informed that their consumers are lodging complaints about current practice which it is indeed difficult to accept . This is because transfers do not only generate a high cost at their point of origin .
The problem in Ast@@ uri@@ as , where there have been reti@@ re@@ ments and early reti@@ re@@ ments , is that young people today have no prospects because more than 30 000 jobs have been lost .
Things have certainly improved in this area , but the general level of public awareness is not yet satisfactory , and the subject is not one that s@@ ells itself automatically .
That is when it all started .
We must solve these problems .
We must naturally include young people in this debate - it is their future in Europe we are discussing - as well as the candidate countries , as they too will be involved in building the Europe of the future .
If we are to begin this discussion at the right end , we should , just like the school pupils in Brussels and the contributions on the website , ask the fundamental questions of what tasks we want the Union to take on and what role we want the Union to play in Europe and globally .
Surely there can be no victory or defeat for one institution over another ; surely there can only be progress or retro@@ gres@@ sion with regard to the overall concept , i.e. the concept of Europe , and we should not lose sight of that .
I , like many of my fellow members , are worried about wra@@ pping this up in 2004 in the middle of the European election campaign .
At Stockholm , Member States will have to swe@@ ep away the tax barriers that obstruc@@ t the cross @-@ border payment of pension contributions and the cross @-@ border management of pension funds .
The current &apos; close to balance &apos; rule in the EMU Stability and Growth Pact has done a great service to the cause of safe pensions .
Secondly : full employment , to us , means quality jobs .
We are trying to establish close long @-@ term cooperation at all levels between the EU and the UN .
In this work , it is important that people receive on @-@ going information in order to be able to assess connections and the whole picture .
And if we too had made an effort to impose self @-@ control on the markets at worldwide level , at least to the extent to which we are able to exert an influence , we would perhaps not now have reached a point at which we are threatened by the imminent economic crisis in the United States .
Therefore , according to our view of the issue , we insist that we need to continue to maintain a budgetary policy aimed at balancing public finances . We also believe that wage policy must be compatible with non @-@ infl@@ ation@@ ist growth and the creation of employment and that monetary policy must remain committed to price stability .
I would ask you to vote in favour of the former .
We have built many of Mr Mart@@ í@@ nez Mart@@ í@@ nez &apos;s ideas into the new rules .
I am looking forward to the cooperation within this framework .
Meanwhile , you are aware that the framework directive says that participation from citizens is very important and , so far , associations such as AD@@ EN@@ A , Ec@@ ologi@@ stas en Ac@@ ción or groups of experts have not received an official response to their very well @-@ documented allegations .
I would like to make just two points . The first relates to drug pat@@ enting .
In terms of research and genetic manipulation , many of us would support som@@ atic cell repair but might have doubts about som@@ atic cell enhan@@ cement or ger@@ m cell repair and certainly there will be grave concerns about ger@@ m @-@ cell enhan@@ cement .
Motion for a resolution ( B5 @-@ 017@@ 2 / 2001 ) , by Mr El@@ mar Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on developing the Union &apos;s capabilities in conflict prevention and civil crisis management
The report underlines the importance the EU attaches to the Ukraine .
The adoption of a constructive position by the Angol@@ an Government would obviously be welcomed by the international community .
Timor , Mol@@ u@@ cc@@ as , Ac@@ eh , Pap@@ ua and now Bor@@ neo @-@ Kali@@ man@@ tan all show this .
Vice @-@ President O@@ ne@@ sta has contacted my colleague , Commissioner Diam@@ ant@@ opoulou , suggesting that the Commission puts forward a proposal to the Council and Parliament for an amendment to this regulation , allowing assistants to chose between the Member State where they work , the Member State where they were last insu@@ red or the Member State of which they are a national .
Of the two , I am more embar@@ ras@@ sed in respect of the assistants &apos; statute because this is a case where as MEPs we are directly responsible in matters affecting the lives of others .
This progress , which has been made thanks to the per@@ sever@@ ance of the Association of Assi@@ stants and to the efficient work of our Vice @-@ President , G@@ ér@@ ard O@@ ne@@ sta , served as a base for our neg@@ ations with the Council .
It appears that PVC also has certain advantages as a material . B@@ lood trans@@ fusion bags are often cited in this connection .
We would like to see it extended to all categories , not just to some .
He mentioned social aspects and so on .
Mr Bla@@ k , the general rapporteur for the budget discharge , adopted exactly this approach to the wide @-@ ranging control of a broad spectrum of policy areas in respect of which public money is spent .
But let me remind you that although you were all good enough to come to the Committee - and I thank you for that - it was rather ir@@ k@@ some that you could not bring yourselves to respond in such unequi@@ vocal terms in the Committee .
The EU should embark on an eventual vaccination programme so that countries free of infection and disease do not have to un@@ duly suffer .
I ask the Commissioner today , who has been doing an extremely good job , to consider increasing the level of sam@@ pling as an initial step .
I set great store by the fact that we should join forces in this time of crisis , and that we should adhere to a Europe @-@ wide approach .
We therefore urge the Commissioner to revise the EU strategy of defending , by all means , its F@@ M@@ D @-@ free status , and to recognise that the cul@@ ling and destruction of healthy animals is both in@@ humane and ineffective .
You must tell us what you think about vaccination .
The EU &apos;s &quot; no vaccination &quot; policy has always been justified in terms of exports to third countries .
How many studies have been conducted in this area ?
I commend this report , the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy &apos;s additions to his work .
I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radic@@ als .
That is what is laid down in the interpre@@ tative communication .
The next item is the report by the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the outcome of the European Council of 23 and 24 March in Stockholm , including the situation in the Middle East .
On the basis of these premises , the Commission urged the European Council to commit the Member States to taking action at the very least in six key sectors in which fresh impetus is needed .
The Lamfalussy report transfers legislative power from elected representatives in open assemb@@ lies to officials behind the closed doors of committee rooms .
( IT ) Mr President , I told you just now that I had dropped off for a moment .
( The President cut the speaker off )
In my region , for example , the port of D@@ over will be encouraged to switch more goods from roads to railways .
Therefore it is reasonable to call for other professionals to identify their clients properly and report suspi@@ cious transactions without narro@@ wing too much the scope of the relevant activities .
I agree with Baroness Lud@@ ford when she says that in this respect the proposal is a good compromise between protecting fundamental rights when lawyers defend their clients in court or help the clients to determine their legal position , but not when they are participating in preparations leading up to an activity covered by this directive .
In order to achieve this objective , a public information system must also be in place which can inform Europe &apos; s citizens of their rights .
The Commission is therefore absolutely on the same wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th as the European Parliament and I can only welcome this . But our main concern , naturally , is to prepare this coordination in the correct manner .
Refer@@ ring this matter to the Council of Europe , therefore , fully endor@@ ses the approach that I took when this matter first arose .
Thank you , Mrs Hautala .
I would like to end by remin@@ ding Mr Man@@ isco that the law is not a protocol formali@@ ty .
It is true that , in politics , there is sometimes exagger@@ ation , very often personal comments are made , and we have witnessed precisely that in this Chamber today .
Vir@@ tually all documents will be placed on a public register .
What is more , I agree with what has been said about the procedure itself , namely that it is extremely difficult to understand how , as part of an informal process I would character@@ ise as very dubious , the negotiations concerning such a sensitive and important subject could have taken place between the committee , the Council and the Commission but not been subject to scrutiny by ordinary Members of Parliament and the general public .
It is a step for@@ wards in many ways .
In the long run , it would be desirable if measures based upon Article 29 of the EU Treaty could be included in Title IV of the EC Treaty so that appropriate decisions for the settlement of issues for which other kinds of measures are un@@ suitable could be adopted in a un@@ it@@ ary fashion .
We must now shoulder the responsibility , in other words , to postpone the change@@ over to coins and notes until next January - would it matter after everything we have been through ? This would , in any case , be desirable for several other reasons .
There are many of us who are not very up @-@ to @-@ date in terms of what can or cannot be done on fer@@ re@@ ts in relation to immunity testing .
This will allow an in @-@ depth discussion with the European Parliament and the Council on all relevant matters .
I agree very much with what Mr K@@ ati@@ for@@ is said about the question of public investment .
For me , lifelong learning is far too often a set phrase and far too sel@@ dom a requirement , con@@ spic@@ uous by its absence from curricul@@ a and sy@@ ll@@ abuses .
Mr President , I know my place , and we can therefore make a start on this subject matter .
This is what accounting in the European Union should not become .
Secondly , the proposal also lays down rules for Member States to define the scope of companies that shall be permitted or can be required to use fair value .
Therefore , as representative of the Pension@@ ers &apos; Party , I would like to stress how important it is for pension funds to be managed properly in the States of the European Union .
I can inform you today that work is already under way to re@@ constitute the Commission &apos;s Ad@@ visory Committee on Can@@ cer Pre@@ vention and to create its working group on tobacco .
The question we have to address is : what can Europe do ?
She said that the European Parliament was the origin@@ ator of every campaign to ensure that education is something other than a regional and national element and to ensure not only that the European dimension of education should be a matter for discussion , but that its beneficial effects should be recognised .
I find myself in a pleasant situation today because my country , Austria , leads the field in Europe for schools networking in connection with e @-@ Learning and the new media .
So , over the next ten years - as my colleague has said - the area we should focus on is ensuring that people now in middle age are given the tools of knowledge , information and education in order to be able to live in the altered world which will be coming about .
Things are moving on all sides , though ad@@ mittedly not always in the right direction , but then we are learning lessons as well .
As far as inflation is concerned , current forecasts indicate that prices are set to rise by more than 2 % in two consecutive years , thereby exceeding the bo@@ unds of price stability as defined by the European Central Bank itself .
However , none of this alone will trigger a high rate of growth in the European economy .
A socially committed market economy encourages social responsibility , ecological sustainability and an education policy rooted in the principle of lifelong learning .
The throw @-@ away ment@@ ality is an important factor which must also be taken into account when financing is discussed here .
That is fine .
This is crucial , or we will end up with conflic@@ ting decisions .
Mr President , now that the Berlin Wall has gone , the walls around Europe must also be ra@@ zed to the ground .
However , the vessel was poorly maintained , had a poorly trained crew and had been detained in a Dutch port three times before the accident occurred .
On the Israeli side there is no justification for the disproportionate use of force against civilians and the destruction of property .
Our opinions must take second place if we want to be taken seriously as peace bro@@ kers .
Why not make sure we can re @-@ energ@@ ise the transatlantic business dialogue ?
In the Dutch press , there was an appeal to President Bush in letter form from what the author himself called &quot; the profitable part of American industry &quot; asking the president not to listen only to in@@ efficient companies when environmental decisions were involved .
Nevertheless , it left out important issues which the rapporteur has referred back to the European Parliament for second reading , and for which we have voted .
All prisoners must be treated equally .
I do not think that an explicit reference to the rights of women and Ber@@ bers is too much to ask . This association agreement should also provide for the respect of the civil , cultural and linguistic rights of Alger@@ ian Ber@@ bers .
I am convinced that , with its usual di@@ li@@ gence and promp@@ tness , the Commission will see to it that this new scheme , whose main aim is to benefit the least developed countries , is not abused .
The European Union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes .
Like the previous speaker , I consider that this agreement cannot come under the gentlemen &apos;s agreement because it does not concern administrative expenditure .
It is good that the Commission has left room for manoeuvre in internal policy .
Cooperation in the groups required there to be increasingly close contacts between their constitu@@ ent parties and with the national parties .
At the same time , the clear distinction between political groups in the European Parliament and European political parties is maintained for the next legislat@@ ure , particularly as regards their buildings and staff .
That is why I was aston@@ ished - I must mention this now - to see a statement by Mess@@ rs Ku@@ hne and Van Hul@@ ten in Eur@@ one@@ ws .
That is why it is important for there also to be recourse to the EC@@ J .
It has made declarations proposing the process and - where necessary - vo@@ icing its concerns .
We call on the governments of these countries to do everything in their power to combat and pun@@ ish the criminal practices of child traffi@@ ckers .
The debate is closed .
Obviously it would be helpful to push this development forward .
The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states .
I also hope the President of the Republic , who has the power to intervene , will correct this approach , but if the Seg@@ uro resolution is passed tomorrow - and I would have liked to make it even stronger - we have to recognise that it is a proposal contradic@@ ting the recent statements by Mr Jo@@ spin and the French government .
They should be free to decide what to do - as long as they are efficient .
I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency and the Commission for excellent te@@ am@@ work .
Ac@@ ci@@ dent research shows that the risk of serious injury is seven times higher for children who do not use a restraint system than for children who do use such a system .
There is also the question about dealing with tax problems for frontier workers .
There are pension problems and insurance problems and regulations on movements of workers and their pensions need to work better and faster , as we have already heard .
However , I cannot fail to recommend the Danish model .
Mr Kinnock received only one question , yet his name remains on the list .
One of these was the time @-@ honoured amendment that the Committee on Budgets keeps tabling for the inclusion of a recital emphasi@@ sing the indispens@@ ability of transparency , scrutiny and compliance with budgetary procedure .
The end result should put beyond doubt the quality and safety of all food products , and provide the assurances consumers have been seeking and to which they are entitled .
Op@@ enness and appointments based on merit are essential .
This morning we are discussing the subject of the food inspec@@ torate , and perhaps we shall be doing so again in the future .
This proposal is contained in paragraph 28 of the M@@ end@@ é@@ z de Vigo and Seg@@ uro report on the conclusions to be drawn from the Treaty of Nice , and we shall insist on the earliest possible introduction of this amendment to the EC Treaty .
Ministers have to attend so many summit meetings : every other week , they have to attend some summit or other .
Therefore , I support the proposal contained in paragraph 10 of the report which calls for any state to be excluded which clearly fails to respect human rights , democracy and the rule of law from AS@@ EM activities .
To this end , the Maastricht reform drew up the CFSP and for the same purpose various proposals are currently being considered with a view to 2004 .
We should also concentrate on greater coordination of the information received so that we do not have to witness such sad spectac@@ les as the Member States giving differing opinions .
In the textile and agriculture sectors , developing countries often have compar@@ atively large advantages , and there we are retaining tariff protection .
Naturally , I and many others are disappointed with the referendum result there , but it is therefore even more important that the work on rati@@ fying the Treaty of Nice progres@@ ses , as it is the very foundation for the enlargement negotiations .
It is not only absolutely ridiculous that the 15 Heads of State should dedic@@ ate themselves to contem@@ pl@@ ating the European Union &apos; s nav@@ el a few months away from a World Summit , which is being held with the aim of putting this model of global development into perspective ; it would also be a complete waste of time .
If we are serious about promoting a transfer of freight traffic from road to rail , with all of the environmental benefits that this can bring , then this too is a very important consideration .
Once the initial excitement is over , the institutions , including Parliament , rela@@ pse into their slow procedures , which is a pity .
But I must say that Amendments Nos 29 , 31 , 34 to 42 , 52 and 57 also cause problems for the Commission because their aim is to strengthen the participation of the local representatives of the poll@@ uted region in the CO@@ PE Fund committee procedures .
But now the people must show willing and understand that the circle of violence has to be broken .
This adjustment has , of course , been approved in the report that I am presenting . Some amendments have also been tabled , which I would like to take you through briefly .
With the regional integration of the Caribbean islands into the Americ@@ as &apos; free trade area lo@@ oming in 2005 , the overseas territories will have to cont@@ end with unfair competition from their neighbours .
They should have been , and an undertaking was given that they would be before a tender was awarded , but they were not consulted .
This is not one such area .
.
But we must begin and we must put down a mark@@ er now .
The decision taken today has immediate effect until 30 June and will be reviewed in the meantime .
Amendment No 23 concerns the introduction of an article on the potential use of mark@@ er vaccines .
( Applause )
This House does not want the Commissioner to fail , we want her to succeed .
Those telling us today that this will be a mere formali@@ ty are the same people who were bur@@ ying their heads in the sand before the recent referendum .
But this directive provides for a first step towards creating such a level playing field by protecting all shareholders , and in particular minority shareholders , in the case of a change of control in their companies .
This example highlights the differences between the European Parliament and the Council in dealing with Commission proposals and decisions .
The high costs in countries like Austria are partly attri@@ but@@ able to the fact that we have virtually introduced a separate insurance system for each professional group .
I refer , in particular , to the coordination of economic policies .
The general aim of the proposals is to provide improved protection for policy@@ holders by increasing the capital resources of insurance companies and by ensuring more efficient state supervision of insurance companies .
In Europe much has already been done to fight cy@@ ber crime .
That is why , at the end of this debate , I should like to express the wish that you will be equal to your own ambition and that you will enjoy success .
The K@@ LA has been given organisational structures which it did not have before .
Conditions for rapid adoption by Parliament will be that the decision on a hostile bid should rest not with the shareholders but with the Board of Management , that the Board of Management should decide in the light of all interests , i.e. also those of the employees , that the new proposal creates a true &quot; level playing field &quot; in Europe , which means , for example , that government intervention , in the form of &quot; golden shares &quot; or anything else , to combat take@@ over@@ s , should be banned , and that companies in the EU are allowed to maintain at any rate the same protection constructions as in the US .
In truth , we are a long way off meeting the standards set in the Kyoto Protocol .
We would like these realities to be included in the future Constitution .
K@@ FOR therefore shares the blame for developments in Macedonia and the out@@ breaks of fresh conflict .
( A5 @-@ 0@@ 23@@ 8 / 2001 ) by Mrs Hau@@ g , on the situation concerning the European Union &apos; s own resources in 2001 &#91; 2001 / 20@@ 19 ( INI ) &#93; ;
I shall end here , in the hope that on 20 July - the date scheduled for the conciliation meeting - the positive and constructive spirit that I personally feel , will spread to all of those present .
It has to be said al@@ ou@@ d that the United Kingdom is one of the EU members getting a free ride . It has been given a reduction on contributions .
I would recommend a positive vote tomorrow and , I hope , rapid action by the Commission to implement the recommendations .
In practical terms , we must apply the rules of subsidiarity and decentrali@@ sation , although consistency remains essential .
Since you raise the subject , I should tell you that we were faced with some very difficult incidents yesterday .
As a former Member of Parliament in the West Country , he will know that industry extremely well .
We have brought about a great many improvements with cars and lor@@ ries over recent years and we should seek to achieve fundamental improvements in the recreational craft sector .
There are certainly sound reasons for having such a range , without my explaining in more detail what I mean .
Although we are only now beginning to recognise the new challenges that will face the coastal regions in the decades to come , the integrated coastal zone management strategy cannot de@@ cent@@ ly ignore them .
Fund@@ ing is desperately needed to pay for the damages incurred in war in 1999 , but now , it mainly appears to be a means to reward agre@@ eable leaders and pun@@ ish others .
Secondly , we must make it clear that it is time to move on to the next stage , which is to prepare for the General Assembly of the United Nations and the possibility of adopting a resolution on a moratorium on exec@@ utions .
Dis@@ sidents often disappear behind bars for a ridi@@ cul@@ ously long period of time .
A real political mi@@ racle has taken place there , which is firmly ing@@ ra@@ ined in our minds : the country moved from apar@@ thei@@ d to democracy .
In acknowled@@ ging the directive &apos;s success , I should also like to acknowledge , as the report does , the role played by the trade unions , in particular the trade unions at European Union level .
In reality , however , if members of the minority have good enough reasons and if application does not follow through on ground level , nothing is solved .
Thank you in advance .
It is clear that the only way of breaking the current dead@@ lock is through the intervention of a third party .
Commissioner , when the euro is introduced next year , more money will be available and we ought then to conduct a major campaign to make clear that the economic and political advantages of enlargement extend far beyond the debate about costs .
As soon as the meeting fin@@ ishes she will join us .
Allow me to say a few words about Estonia , that fascinating little country on the Baltic .
The European Union is not rigid .
The question is not , however , of a purely institutional nature : it is also a budgetary issue .
If we want to bring these nations - and our own nations - on board , we need to show them a Europe of security , peace , culture and individu@@ ality , not just the sexual individu@@ ality which is often the subject of debate , but cultural individu@@ ality , because people do not just have multiple sexual needs , they also have multiple spiritual and cultural needs and linguistic diversity .
I am talking about the delegation of practical and technical activities , not political delegation , for no delegation is permitted in these areas . They are subjects which must be dealt with by the institutional authorities .
Mr President , I am in favour of anything that leads to the standardisation of safety regulations in air transportation .
If we want to continue improving emissions , the 108 % clause must be withdrawn , because otherwise , some of the better lor@@ ries might stop transi@@ ting through Austria because they have too many eco@@ points and lack transit rights as a result of this 108 % .
If that is true , it is an incredibly serious matter .
Of the four main recommendations in this report ( the definition of the crime of terrorism and applicable penalties , removal of the formal extradition procedure , the application of the principle of mutual recognition of criminal judgments and the European search and arrest warrant ) , I wanted to specifically highlight the last one relating to compensation for the victims of terrorism which , perhaps , has been the one least mentioned by other Members . In this respect , I wish to highlight the fact that this House already adopted , on 24 November 2000 , a report for which I had the honour of being rapporteur , which determined , for the first time , the definition of victims and their role in the judicial process .
However , we are not in favour of creating a European Aviation Safety Agency ( A@@ ESA ) on the basis proposed .
Our concerns about trafficking in children as the world was be@@ ating a path to their door in search of children became obs@@ cu@@ red between the desper@@ ation of parents looking for children to adopt and the clear indications that many of those who were facilitating commercial trafficking in children became part of the politics of Romania , and indeed those countries whose nationals were pres@@ sur@@ ising for open adoption , notably the USA .
I would say that , on the cancellation of debt , little progress has been made .
I have thus carefully listened to all the speeches from the left , the right and the centre in this debate , and you can be certain that a number of elements will definitely inspire us .
If the European Council meetings are only to take place in Belgium in future , has the idea of its own designated location been considered ?
I will not quote the former Prime Minister of Belgium when I had the tem@@ er@@ ity to formulate this suggestion in my own national parliament but I can tell you in private afterwards .
The supplementary question is not the same , as its name suggests . It is a supplementary question .
Of course , there are appeals , decisions can be appe@@ aled against , but I believe that in this , in the guarantees for the parties involved in the proceedings , the greatest guarantees must be assured .
As soon as sufficient information becomes available , the Commission will consider whether or not to prepare a legislative proposal for a horizontal regulation .
It was in 1975 that the Fru@@ it Ju@@ ice Directive first introduced consumers to the designation &apos; fruit juice &apos; or reinforced it , and consumers have got used to it .
As far as the following stage is concerned , which is the implementation of Article 96 of Cotonou , which we call consultation and adoption of appropriate measures , again in conventional language , the Council will look at this issue at the beginning of October with , of course , our participation , and we will decide then whether or not we will take this step .
The impact of HIV is enormous .
They deal with terrorist crimes within the Union but do nothing to improve cooperation with countries outside the EU .
This fills me with incredible horror and fear , as it means that we are facing a world in which there are millions of potential terrorists and perpetrators of similar ou@@ trages .
My second point concerns procedures for the future .
I will therefore , when the time is right , propose a policy that will involve , with different degrees of intensity depending on the level of development , all regions in Europe and all countries in Europe , while endeav@@ ouring - I am responding here to Mr. Lage - to treat all of these regions even @-@ han@@ de@@ dly , in particular so as to avoid , Mr Lage , the mechanical effect that I myself raised in the cohesion report and the statistical effect that could , if applied without due care and attention , pen@@ alise regions currently within the EU .
We cannot open doors we are then unable to close , and we in the European Union cannot receive all the alleged victims who want to leave their country for this reason .
In this day and age , when evi@@ dently many find the money and the means to come to Europe and seek asylum , asylum procedures must be strict and straightforward .
Madam President , I wish to pay tribute to the clarity of the proposals contained in Mr Watson &apos; s report on the granting of refugee status .
Unfortunately , we were unable to get anywhere with that point of view last week in the Conference of Presidents , and that is something we regret .
France did not ask for any such assistance from our Civil Protection Unit .
What , precisely , can be done about this ?
We are aware that many of Mr Kinnock &apos; s proposed reforms have come up against pretty form@@ id@@ able resistance .
Therefore , this is a very important debate , and I am delighted that not just the Commissioner but the President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr Du@@ ques@@ ne , are here in person , recognising the importance of this issue .
Although I agree with his motivation , we must admit that this approach is not a safe one .
In accordance with the Islamic law of the country , the prosec@@ utor is demanding the death penalty for conducting Christian mis@@ sion@@ ary activities .
Since interpretations of the judgments of the Court are not always unanimous , it is time to create a synthesis of all the various interpretations in order to determine clearly our future action .
This un@@ fairness unfortunately har@@ med the credibility of the NGOs and damaged the prestige of the Conference on Rac@@ ism .
It will be one small step towards fre@@ eing a lot of people who , as I said earlier , have been tra@@ pped .
It will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings when the amendments are tabled .
On the basis of the positive experience on the other side of the Atlantic , the Commission is convinced that the Energy Star labelling programme will naturally lead to the gradual elimination of in@@ efficient equipment on the Community market .
Equal opportunities should also apply geographi@@ cally , given the huge discrepan@@ cies between the regions of the European Union when it comes to innovation .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I was keen to inform you as quickly as possible about the progress of the work done at the extraordinary European Council held on 21 September involving the Heads of State and Government of the European Union .
The second series of measures in the action plan , which I consider to be very important , involves the development of international legal instruments .
On this issue , the Commission will dev@@ ise projects to assist Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries .
My group would like all Commissioners to explain themselves before this House .
I should like to highlight two things that are necessary to the European agenda .
I think that would be very dangerous , so I am not in favour of it .
We met the ex@@ iled Afghan King , Mohammed Za@@ hir Sha@@ h , who ruled for 40 years until 1973 and who in 1964 introduced free elections and a free media and brought women into politics .
Mr President , I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of terrorism .
So the question is , how can we manage the problem better ?
If it appears , however , that one or more Member States are solely responsible for the issue as a whole , I shall be unable to give you an answer on behalf of the Council .
On behalf of the Committee on Budgets , which I have the honour of representing institution@@ ally , I must express the profound disappointment of my committee at the treatment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our amendments , and please do not interpret this as in any way a personal opinion .
No one - not in this House anyway - wants to print money .
My intention in paragraph 14 was to ensure that if we are to find the lowest prices for medicines for poor countries and for the patients in these countries , we must ensure that the developing countries do not impose import duty and taxes on imports of essential medicines .
Apart from the fact that we refuse to set a precedent on urgent procedures , which could then dramatically increase , we have questions regarding the list proposed in the annex , which reveals genuine and fundamental problems .
These diseases cause not only human suffering and an extremely high number of deaths , which are in themselves justification enough for such a response , but also cause a drastic reduction in life expec@@ tancy and in the labour force , with all the social and economic consequences that this entails They seriously disable large working populations , ret@@ ard social and economic development and destabili@@ se communities that are already weakened .
Mr President , Colombia - one of South America &apos;s oldest democracies and a country which , un@@ usually for this continent , has not been pr@@ one to military dictatorship - is tra@@ gi@@ cally a victim of 37 years of civil war and terrorist activity , which have destroyed infrastructure , killed 40 000 people and cor@@ rupted its civil and military authorities through guer@@ ri@@ lla involvement with the drugs trade .
The close links between the army and its illegal right arm , the paramilit@@ aries , is well known and the &quot; Human Rights Watch &quot; report , published today , only serves to underline this .
Today , the European Parliament , through its vote , will decide between the reality and the Directive .
Madam President , we are a small delegation of MEPs who have just come back from the Clin@@ ique Sa@@ inte Bar@@ be here in Strasbourg , to which a former Che@@ chen minister , Mr I@@ bra@@ gi@@ mo@@ v , had been admitted after having been on hunger strike for 27 days .
This regulation does not apply in Denmark , Ireland or the United Kingdom .
The rapporteur recognises that the risk of financial instability is inherent to the operation of the economy .
I believe in actual fact that , in preparing the assessments , it has been forgotten that the directive only applies to employees and not to people who are self @-@ employed .
Not only is the euro not a major currency , but its value has de@@ preci@@ ated , it is permanently on the ver@@ ge of a crisis of confidence , and its international role is not progres@@ sing .
We understand , Commissioner , that innovation is a multi@@ dimensional , composite concept and , as such , hard to define and con@@ fine to specific sectors or lines of action .
Countries must take active measures to promote equality in practice .
So we must agree with the rapporteur and endorse her satisfaction with the Commission initiative which , with the proposed regulation , creates the legal basis for classi@@ fying territorial units for statistics .
Without such an instrument , Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world .
This obviously requires considerable re@@ organisation of the agenda and discipline in the conduct of meetings .
With reference to the Council , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would obviously like to say that , from my point of view , each of our institutions is autonomous and has primary responsibility for its own reforms .
Eff@@ ective political action cannot change its priorities every six months .
We must indeed hope that at least as strong a delegation arri@@ ves from the United States Congress as from here ; without them we will be a bit one @-@ sided .
It would distra@@ ct attention from the un@@ finished development business and increase the risk that developing countries will end up accepting disadvanta@@ geous trade @-@ off@@ s .
The voluntary organisations must be given scope to express their opinions when world trade is discussed .
This can happen if we do not remain vigilant and at the same time put the issue of human rights at the centre of our foreign policy .
Let us hand over responsibility for the Stability Pact to those who can manage it and take it away from those who have in any case already begun to abandon it .
We will have to assess this on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
It is not acceptable for it to deny that Christian As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , Chal@@ de@@ ans and Syri@@ ans were also exposed to a genocide in which hundreds of thousands of people were murdered following a fat@@ wa concerning holy war on the Christians , issued in 1914 by the top Muslim leader .
In fact , our inability to embrace diversity becomes a major source of conflict among peoples .
My explanation is therefore intended to correct , as far as possible , the result of the vote .
It is beyond question that today &apos; s border regions will benefit from European Union enlargement in the long term since there will be totally new opportunities for economic , cultural , social and administrative regional cooperation .
This par@@ enth@@ e@@ tical remark by the Commission must surely pull us up short .
For Scotland and similar countries this will only be a start , but it will be an important one .
As many of you have also emphasised , the most important point of the proposed reform is the replacement of the variable defici@@ ency payments by a fixed @-@ rate form of aid .
Mr President , I would like to join in congratulating our rapporteur , Mr Gal@@ la@@ gher , on the sensitivity and speed with which he has produced his report .
The Minutes of Thursday 25 October have been distributed .
It is quite clear that Parliament must get its own house in order after the agreements we have had vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Commission .
The most important thing is that during this period there was time to be able to reflect upon the following : in the first instance , we have to remove the current contradiction in the Rules of Procedure ; this is absolutely crucial if we want to prevent the same doubts we had in July 1999 arising next January .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will first thank the rapporteur , who has analysed this very technical report with great expertise and proposed a range of editorial amendments that we can all support .
I think everyone here tonight is working on legislation in the electronic age .
I should like to make the following observations with regard to transport times .
Let me nonetheless indicate some general impressions on some of the key issues raised in your report .
Concerning the budget management for 2000 , one particular feature of budget implementation was the emergence of a very large surplus of revenue over expenditure , amounting to EUR 11.@@ 6 billion , equivalent to more than 14 % of final payment expenditure .
I should like to see the Commission make proposals for extending this system to include other sectors of the budget , notably the Structural Funds .
Would it be a million , 10 million or even 100 million ?
If , however , there are problems despite , or possibly even because of , the existing approach , then we should be brave enough to change it .
I repeat that the Commission has every interest in rigorous , complete and honest evaluation of the results of Community legislation .
The second opinion , formulated by Mess@@ rs Martin and Bon@@ de , and included in the amendments tabled by the Greens , is that the EP has , in fact , created unnecessary , self @-@ imposed restrictions by striking deals with the Commission and the Council and that we have sadly not yet seen a majority in favour of total public access in this Parliament .
If we do not achieve this but are content just to implement mutual recognition of decisions , we will be taking a step backwards in the practical integration of Europe .
Similarly , the policy that has led to the dis@@ appearance of small slaugh@@ ter@@ houses , including in remote areas , has had per@@ ni@@ cious effects .
We were unable to support a report that places us in the position of observer .
Mr President , the main problem with the Commission &apos;s proposal is that local public transport is subordin@@ ated to the objective of &apos; free competition &apos; alone .
However , we believe that , until certain exceptions are incorporated , it is necessary , in a transitional and exceptional fashion , to accept certain types of clause which limit access to a market .
I think that pil@@ otage can also be retained in the directive .
We must not forget that British expor@@ ters benefit from reasonably priced port services in continental Europe .
We are confident that the enlargement negotiations can be successfully completely on the basis of the current acquis .
Commissioner , there are agreements between some of the candidate countries , such as the customs union agreement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia , rather than the Vis@@ eg@@ rad agreement , which could render the situation rather more complex should only one of the two countries join the Union , for example , if the Czech Republic were to join but not Slovakia or vice versa .
In no Member State is the religion of an identity card holder mentioned on the card .
That is a basic error in the system .
I had already demanded this in this House in connection with the Mc@@ N@@ ally Report on women and science , and , in order to implement it , the Commission set up a Gender Unit , which now has some early successes to show .
More than 15 % has been set aside for small@@ - and medium @-@ sized enterprises , and that too is one of our priorities .
In other contexts , it is usual to applaud Finnish innovation policy .
This does not , of course , mean that we disagree with the seven thematic priorities proposed .
As far as bio@@ ethics is concerned , I urge support for the proposal by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , which simply takes account of the different understand@@ ings of the law on this subject in the Member States , and we as European legislators cannot sup@@ plant the Member States on this point .
Our development depends first and foremost on the viability of our social model .
We feel it is completely inappropriate to seek to open up all port services to competition regardless of their type , given that some of them , due to their specific obligations , are of a public service nature .
Apart from national differences regarding the very concept of public service as applied to port services , optimum safety must be ensured in all Member States . They alone can define and control this by means of public service tasks , professional qualifications , restrictions or the definition of their activities .
Yes , we must also give the Afghan people all the material aid it needs to recover from a disastrous humanitarian situation , in which , as Mr Wur@@ tz said , we fear for the survival of 1.5 million Afgh@@ ans who are at risk of fam@@ ine and for the health of more than 6 million who are now at risk of serious mal@@ nutrition .
In this section , there is no room for solutions such as that proposed by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , which , by taking an extremely orthodo@@ x position in opposition to public aid , would have disastrous consequences for the European ship@@ building sector .
But I can reassure you that we do not mean digital finger@@ printing .
Mr President , I thank the Commission for the brave proposal for a Regulation and congratulate Mrs Pei@@ js for her long @-@ term commitment to this matter , without which we probably would have been unable to convince the Commission and the Council of the need for this legislative initiative .
The existing minimum taxation requirement - the so @-@ called 57 % rule - allows for a higher degree of price manipulation and would not in itself be sufficient to reduce to a sustainable level the gap between the tax and price levels of the present Member States and the candidate countries .
Therefore , with all due respect to Mr Fo@@ li@@ as , his reasoning is not in line with reality .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to support the position expressed by the Chair@@ person of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the issue we are debating .
I believe - to stress this once more - that we need to listen more closely to what members of the public have to say , pay more attention to their problems and then take appropriate action .
Energy policy should safeguard cheap energy for grass @-@ roots needs , guarantee the safety of workers and citizens and ensure that the environment is protected .
Over the past few days , Member of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Alexander de Ro@@ o , has ins@@ inu@@ ated both in this House and in the media that the Liberal shadow rapporteur , Chris Davi@@ es , has changed his position under pressure from the Aznar Government in connection with the possible election of P@@ at Cox to President of Parliament .
Instead of the promised development , the opening up of the markets to huge companies and to the financial establishment has pl@@ ung@@ ed Latin America into poverty .
There must be a genuine re@@ think of transport policy at European level .
Why , then , not ask for their views before we do anything in their name ?
Do not think that the European Parliament gave its support to the Convention because of some kind of ob@@ session .
We have to remember that Europe is asking us to give a positive indication .
I may thus be able to reassure those of you who already see a thousand and one reasons in the Convention for sacrific@@ ing some things that they have always believed in , and which are , in fact , cri@@ p@@ pling Europe .
The debate needs to take place .
The oral questions and resolutions are intended to question the political powers of these countries and to give them time to debate and respond to those questions .
The other provisions of the Commission proposal were discussed in the Article 36 Committee on 22 and 23 November .
This is the situation with regard to the crime of terrorism itself .
Le@@ aving aside the special military tri@@ bun@@ als set up by President Bush , it is enough to reflect upon the recent laws issued or proposed in Italy or in the United Kingdom in order to understand that their objective is to cur@@ b and control growing political opposition to a world social and economic order which is unfair and in@@ human : the wealth , well @-@ being , growth and development of a fifth of the human race are mir@@ ro@@ red by the star@@ vation , lack of resources , ongoing economic decline and under@@ development of the other four fif@@ ths .
Document 30 had previously been used for general guidance only .
Mr President , I , too , want to make it clear to the rapporteur that , here , nobody has proposed rejecting the association agreement with Egypt .
How will those that need this money , namely the countries of the South , be involved in these decisions ? It is not simply up to the donor countries .
I believe we should favour this option since , as well as being promising , it does not involve any kind of ethical or social conflict .
Human life is not created by third parties .
F@@ ärm report ( A5 @-@ 04@@ 10 / 2001 )
I should like to agree with Mr Cro@@ wley &apos;s last couple of comments .
Every government and every interested group will , time and again , try to attract the largest possible subsidies , and to gain maximum freedom in the spending thereof .
Since Mrs A@@ el@@ vo@@ et has taken a bit of a po@@ und@@ ing today I shall pay tribute to her part in it also .
In parallel to this , the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need to establish properly functioning systems for monitoring the safety of food and animal feed before accession .
I would like to highlight another point .
We need availability at a low price ; we need skills and content in everyone &apos;s own language to close the digital divide .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks , Mr Bus@@ hill @-@ Matthe@@ ws , for this excellent report .
For these reasons , which were also set out in writing by Mrs Fontaine on 10 September , we have replaced the catalogue with the much more reliable instrument of quar@@ terly programming , which is what the College uses to plan its work and of which you will be informed at regular intervals .
For me , what is essential is not the name eventually given to the text that grows out of the work of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference .
It must , of course , be admitted that the un@@ foreseen events that took place , which completely turned the political agenda on its head , justified the tabling of proposals to take account of such up@@ heav@@ als , but a careful reading of the texts shows that , to a great extent , these new proposals have nothing to do with the present situation , or , in any case , could have been tabled at some other time , rather than within the context of the programme for 2001 .
Several delegations from developing countries showed their appreciation and satisfaction with the working method used during their closing speeches .
The first is the real involvement of the southern countries and the evidence that multilater@@ alism is effectively beginning to happen .
I decided against it because otherwise the wrong people would yet again be pen@@ alised .
That is why the Commission has proposed that by means of an agreement between the Council , Parliament and the Commission , an extra reserve should be created for additional external policy actions , and I believe that this is in fact the ideal way to avoid un@@ rav@@ elling the financial perspective whilst still addressing the new challenges facing the Community in a Community @-@ oriented way . It would be a good thing if the Laeken Council could also express its support for this approach .
Even after Q@@ atar , the impression remains that not all Member States are adopting that line .
Madam President , Commissioner , this is the second reading of the public health programme and it is important that the European Parliament re @-@ address a number of issues which it considers to be of fundamental importance .
You , the Members of the European Parliament are genuine friends of the Korean people .
We would like to make next year &apos;s World Cup a great turning point for establishing global peace and guaranteeing security for all peoples once again .
Too many acts of violence have been committed during the anti @-@ globalisation demonstrations , and also in some cases too many acts of violence against the demonstr@@ ators or even those arrested , as in the tragic events in Genoa in which a young man was killed , struck down in circumstances that are still unclear .
Daily , these two governments combine in using their huge death @-@ dealing military technology to w@@ re@@ ak far greater destruction than any other of the countless terrorists of world history .
The Council is clearly unwilling to make any fundamental reforms on the basis the commitments made in Tampere , despite the assi@@ du@@ ous efforts of Commissioner Vitorino and the political will demonstrated by the European Parliament .
We are making promises to Mr Arafat and we are agreeing to fight , but for what ?
As for the answers , they are top secret .
Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I would lend you my mobile , but unfortunately , it is broken .
In this connection , the Council is prepared to medi@@ ate in order to create a climate of trust among the parties and hence to facilitate a sustainable solution , but it does not intend to take the place of the United Nations .
The Council was informed that the United Kingdom is very actively monitoring this matter , in conjunction with Mr H@@ ous@@ el &apos; s lawyers .
There is only hope if we actually tackle the in@@ jus@@ tices , and if tolerance , mutual understanding and intense dialogue all over the world become the leading principles .
The fourth message is to promote international cooperation with governments , international organisations and civil society .
There is an extensive agenda for this dialogue .
Secondly , I would mainly call for a prompt completion of the Erika II , and for acceler@@ ating the process in the light of the ti@@ res@@ ome pace on the part of industry with regard to separate funding and such like .
The IO@@ PC Fund will only cover F@@ FR 1.2 billion out of the F@@ FR 5.@@ 5 billion of damages caused , and procedures are turning out to be lengthy , complicated and in@@ efficient .
It is in the final analysis the classification societies that occupy the most vulnerable position in the liability chain .
From the European Parliament &apos; s point of view , the main problem raised by the proposal was that of the subjec@@ tive scope of application of the Directive .
I should be pleased , however , if there were also better safeguards for the cre@@ ws , who do not have an easy life on board oil tan@@ kers , and I should be pleased , above all , if the electronic and navig@@ ational appliances were improved .
Finally , Parliament has recommended on several occasions that same @-@ sex couples be guaranteed the same rights as hetero@@ sexual couples and that the Member States recognise registered partnerships . There have been very positive developments in recent years .
My group is glad that , immediately after the Dutch Homo@@ sexual Marri@@ age Act came into force , the responsible secretariat in the Commission recognised such marri@@ ages where civil servants employed by the Commission are concerned .
One @-@ third of the total fish production that entered international trade in 1998 was worth over USD 50 billion .
But there is no point in l@@ ament@@ ing what is an obvious situation any further , so my proposal is that we should keep trying to influence flag @-@ of @-@ convenience states and remind them of their international obligations .
We also conc@@ ur on Nos 15 , 19 and 22 .
I would like to reassure Parliament that these consultations cover practically the tot@@ ality of the issues raised in their draft resolutions .

Only a few hands were somewhat hesit@@ antly raised .
The very thought of little children being put through that kind of terror is in@@ conceivable .
We call on the reb@@ els to lay down their arms and return to the negotiating table .
No@@ bili@@ a report ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 75 / 2001 )
I would like to start by paying tribute to the Belgian Presidency of the Council for the way it has managed the work during this second half of the year , particularly the work which led to the Laeken Declaration .
Firstly , agreement was reached on the European arrest warrant , a major , sensitive agreement which must be seen as an initial step , to be consolidated by a broader , further @-@ reaching political and institutional project bringing further integration .
Of course , I respect the American model .
It should be possible for the European Council , the European Parliament and the Commission to be equally represented on it .
Mr Bon@@ de : 76 votes
( FR ) On my own behalf and on behalf of all Members , I would like to pay a very sincere tribute to Mrs Nic@@ ole Fontaine ,
Re@@ un@@ iting Europe brings together a divided Europe to share common values and economic prosperity . )
We have now conducted our parliamentary business but we are joined also by colleagues from the European Commission , whose presence I acknowledge with gratitude because this is an important moment in our democratic life in Parliament .
We must ensure that the debate is full and fruitful and , most importantly , that it delivers a vision for the future with which the majority of our citizens can identify .
Great success for you personally , but also for your presidency .
In this regard , I should like to refer to an issue that is closely linked to this : the establishment of the Convention , institutional reforms and the idea of more Europe .
That is what the Commission intends with its proposed text , in which the smoothly functioning internal market and competition swe@@ ep all before them .
Amendments which reduce transparency in calls for competition , in particular Amendments Nos 62 , 68 and 78 , and which extend the scope to negotiate , namely Amendments Nos 57 , part of 61 , 66 and 15@@ 1 .
However , with the assistance of the Commission and the last Belgian Presidency , Parliament has been able in the meantime to use its negotiating powers to turn a simple wish list into a requirement for our various governments to take action which will significantly improve air quality across Europe .

Kau@@ ppi report ( A5 @-@ 04@@ 50 / 2001 )
It would be un@@ wise not simply to limit the minimum maximum penalty of five years to certain crimes but to arrange for it to be applied to all drugs @-@ related crimes .
Rights equal to those of EU citizens in areas such as employment , education and social protection will enhance their economic contribution .
The question arises as to what measures the Commission is taking to prevent the problem of the grey zone from occurring during the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
For example , Amendments Nos 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 35 , 36 and 37 are amendments the Commission can accept , many as they are , some with minor re@@ drafting .
Most of the amendments proposed take these principles into account .
Something that strikes me as also especially important is the committee of market participants , which we decided on .
May I reciproc@@ ate and say that I have always found the discussions with the chair@@ person of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs very fruitful , friendly and , in the end I hope , constructive .
Recomm@@ end@@ ation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to the type @-@ approval of two or three @-@ wheel motor vehicles and repe@@ aling Council Directive 92 / 61 / EEC ( 8@@ 4@@ 02 / 1 / 2001 - C5 @-@ 04@@ 72 / 2001 - 1999 / 0@@ 117 ( COD ) )
( Parliament adopted the joint text )
I would like to say for the record that I did not register my vote today because there was a whol@@ esc@@ ale misuse of language put forward in various amendments which sought to fully conf@@ use the key elements of the debate today .
At this point there are certain opportunities which I would like to mention to you .
I believe that these visits have some consequences .
After months of hear@@ tr@@ ending and meaning@@ less violence in the Middle East , we must now nur@@ se and foster each and every gli@@ mmer of hope .
Mr President , as the last Member to speak in today &apos;s debate , it appears to me that there has been an unusual degree of unanimity , accompanied both by concern and a determination to bring about some sort of happy ending .
We welcome too their cooperation in relation to the seminar .
If this debate does one thing at least , as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and others have said , it may im@@ press upon us that the Member States need to be able to do this .
On the other hand , we can also state that , by the compulsory removal of specific risk material , a guarantee is put in place that the carrier of the disease no longer ends up in the food chain .
At some point , we hope that tests will show that we are at the level we were at prior to the BSE crisis , namely a few cases per ann@@ um .
Our objective is to guarantee food safety , and we will not have reached it as long as our knowledge of this disease is incomplete .
I welcome the strict pres@@ cription of effective tests for BSE in all the Member States , and also the demand that the age for testing be reduced to 24 months .
The cooperation we have had during the negotiations , especially under Mr Mo@@ reira Da Silva &apos; s leadership , has contributed to our having come as far as this on our home ground .
We ignore the main differences , we are not willing or perhaps able to do anything about them or our priorities lie elsewhere and we use the Bologna method to set targets which every Member State has yet to meet .
It will not be good enough now .
It would provide the same proportionate distribution , but it would make it possible for the smaller groups not always to have to take what the large groups leave aside and , in cases where the small groups are not represented , they could be appointed as observers .
If meat @-@ and @-@ bone meal is dangerous , we must make the ban on using it permanent and leave the firms that produce meat @-@ and @-@ bone meal to make something else - maybe they will produce Italian @-@ style sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti or sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with p@@ esto , which would be a much more appropriate subject for debate at this precise moment .
Con@@ sensus has rightly emerged that an important component of the way to re@@ connect Europe with national political life , and through that with European citizens , is through an alliance between the European Parliament and national parliaments and national politics , which at present seem to give insufficient weight to thorough and comprehensive scrutiny of European matters .
But the amendments tabled by the Greens , which one feels are about regional institutions as much as national parliaments , merit your consideration and , in my view , your vote as well .
Furthermore , it has been in@@ still@@ ed into their beliefs and their way of thinking that this was a normal situation , which makes change difficult .
By allowing producers in these departments to supply only the French market with a limited quantity of &apos; traditional &apos; rum for a seven @-@ year period , we are giving these businesses the means to fight against sti@@ ff competition from some third countries and , in doing so , we are protecting the future of thousands of jobs .
I believe that , in this case , there are even more concrete and clear ways , the famous Great wall of China , which would allow us to prevent this type of problem .
I therefore propose that be done .
The Galileo system is crucial if we are to ensure the independence of the Member States of the European Union in the strategic domain of satellite position @-@ finding , since it will mean that they no longer have to depend on the GPS , that the United States controls in a discre@@ tionary fashion .
But I condemn in particular the attacks on the Indian Parliament and the US cultural centre .
I feared that , in my speech here , I would have to pass on a few complaints , for they are obviously brought to my attention .
The present draft resolution is therefore right to point this out .
Firstly , the commitment to hold informal Councils on small and medium @-@ sized businesses , before the structural reform summits in the spring , which can communicate specific recommendations to the spring summits in relation to a sector which represents more than 90 % of European companies and a considerable proportion of employment in our countries .
It is essential to continue to see that environmental considerations are taken into account in other policies .
Our group insi@@ sts that the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact must be adher@@ ed to by all the countries in the eurozone without exception .
No committed European can genuinely be in favour of cur@@ ta@@ iling the rights of Parliament to benefit an already excessively powerful Commission , putting Europe at risk of becoming an un@@ controlled and un@@ controll@@ able bureaucracy .
We are currently implementing a programme to evaluate Socrates II , and the results will be used as a basis for the Commission &apos; s proposals for new initiatives to replace Socrates .
To quote examples , neither child care nor employment policy is harmonised at EU level . These issues are not of a directly cross @-@ border nature .
This is still not the case in Turkey .
Mr President , on a point of order , can we assume from that intervention that all the other Members of the British Labour Delegation believe in socialist principles ?
We do not always know how war begins to become a part of everyday life , but we all know what it can lead to .
Commissioner , I did want to mention a worrying aspect on which I agree with the rapporteur : the budgetary forecasts for the coming years show a decre@@ asing trend in this area .
It is obvious that she has been a parliament@@ arian herself and understands Parliament &apos;s problems and concerns .
Following what the Commission is up to is always slightly difficult unless one is a true initiate of the work@@ ings of the European political system .
On that point , let me observe that , as the budgetary authority , our particip@@ atory roles in the rural development programmes and in the area of traditional income aid are different and that the Commission should please bear that in mind so that it can go ahead on time .
Security of supply , territorial cohesion , network and inter@@ connection development , plant renovation and public service obligations are all essential aspects that involve long @-@ term investment without immediate profitability but which must be guaranteed , if we are to avoid rep@@ lic@@ ating the California crisis .
Yet is fundamentalism not a car@@ ic@@ ature of religion ?
There is also a risk that consumers who use certain do@@ s@@ ages of particular preparations will find this more difficult once this directive has entered into force .
In Germany you can go into any dru@@ g@@ store at all , into any supermarket , and you will be perfectly free to buy vit@@ amins , cal@@ ci@@ um or whatever you want in various different do@@ s@@ ages .
It should say &quot; the competent authorities , &quot; in the plu@@ ral ; there was not any disagreement between the Council and Parliament about this , it was just an error in the wording of the amendment .
The report is un@@ balanced , contradictory and un@@ differentiated , and accordingly totally undermines the battle against discrimination against women .
However , it is my firm belief that it is not the task of the European Union to contribute actively to policy @-@ making in these areas .
While regulators must be v@@ ested with real powers , this does not mean that they should exercise these powers in@@ discrimin@@ ately .
Thank you for your reply .
The initial series of subsidies , which will be awarded in April , will be the first granted by the Fund .
This House has made it very clear that it wishes that investors be given access to a wide range of different equi@@ ties .
We can accept 46 amendments : Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 to 9 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 22 to 26 , 29 , 30 , 38 , 39 , 41 , 43 , 44 to 56 , 58 to 61 , 63 , 64 , 66 to 72 and 75 , but we may have to re@@ draft some of them to ensure the overall coherence of the text .
In pursuing the various objectives I have just outlined in relation to taxation at EU level , the Commission will need to employ a variety of methods , including non @-@ legislative mechanisms .
Amendments Nos 4 to 6 , calling for an assessment of the social and economic impact have already been over@@ taken by events .
Therefore , if we do not agree to start with the compromise amendment , we will first have to vote on Mr Rad@@ wan &apos;s amendment , then Amendments Nos 46 and 32 , which have not lap@@ sed in spite of Mr Rad@@ wan &apos;s amendment .
But I would point out to you that Mr Rad@@ wan &apos;s thoroughly de@@ vious tactics have also caused amendments approved by the Council and the Commission , as well as many Members , to lap@@ se and I think that de@@ vious tactics of this type are a dis@@ credit to Parliament .
The subsequent costs to industry also amount to a disproportionate effect .
To sum up , a good piece of Community legislation is one which choo@@ ses between what is desirable and what is feasible .
In actual fact , the extension of Mugabe &apos;s term of office is a bitter reality .
As democrats , we accept that .
I can fully subscribe to the arguments that have been put forward by Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten . I would like to inform you that the Commission has never called into question the fact that matters of judicial cooperation belong to the third pillar .
This is a hesit@@ ant attitude which , in my view , be@@ fits a Council Sec@@ retariat more than a federal government in the making .
The debate on the directive on family unity is still continuing ; it is therefore un@@ reasonable to define what constitutes a family separately in each directive .
Madam President , on a point of order , I should like to ask you to ask the President of Parliament to register our complaint to the French Government , to the Mayor of Strasbourg and indeed to Air France : some of us were unable to get to the start of the plenary session yesterday because Air France cancelled one of the only direct flights from the UK to Strasbourg .
This is something that should have been rejected .
These are , in my opinion , the areas we must address if we are to achieve proper , sound implementation of the budget in the coming years .
Turning to the agency &apos;s accountability , Parliament has succeeded in giving it greater independence , including from the Commission .
A representative of the Commission is here and has heard your speech , Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten .
I have , on many occasions in the past , asked questions and spoken about both imposing a tax on ker@@ o@@ sen@@ e and a single air space control system .
Men@@ tion is being made of Macedonia and a specific role for the European Union , specifically in Bosnia .
I wanted to reassure Mr Mar@@ set in relation to the law .
As far as the main offices are concerned , the idea of giving the European Patent Office a central role , with some of its work deleg@@ ated to the national offices , is a good idea .
It will create incentives for more environmentally friendly design and for innovations before products have yet come on the market and so reduce the ecological burden of products throughout their lifetime .
( Applause )
Lastly , why do we not speed up Israel &apos;s application to join the European Union ?
What I want to know is whether or not that request has been acc@@ eded to before I proceed with what I might like to say .
On the administrative side , it is nice to see that the administrative formali@@ ties for forming a company have now acquired the cornerstone of the company statute .
Let me also just mention pensions and the need for us to have a good quality directive on pensions - one that avoi@@ ds the pru@@ denti@@ al plus approach .
There have been such failures .
I therefore feel that the European Parliament , the institution which is the voice of the citizens of Europe , must adopt an official position at the Second United Nations World Assembly , due to close tomorrow in Madrid , and we shall do this by voting on the joint motion for a resolution today .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I want to look further , at the whole situation of climate change , which cannot be overlooked , either in the short or the long term .
We urge the parties involved - the Palestinians , the Israelis , the world community - on@@ ward to re@@ double their efforts so that peace may at last reign in the Middle East , so that we Europeans may also have a good future with the countries around the Mediterranean , and so that Israel and Palestine may be able to live within secure borders .
We must ce@@ as@@ el@@ essly remind Mr Arafat that suicide bom@@ b@@ ings are not only mor@@ ally re@@ pu@@ gn@@ ant but also that they stop us helping him to get a Palestinian State .
That is not the situation at present , my friends .
We must prevent any repeti@@ tion of these episodes and be prepared to address and resolve issues as explosive as this one - or as in the case of the Western Sahara , to which no one in this Chamber has referred - and which are extremely important to the creation of an Arab Maghreb union .
It must also be made clear that the right of return for Palestinians can only apply to the new state of Palestine , as otherwise the Jewish State of Israel &apos;s , security would be com@@ promised .
Mr President , it is perhaps more important than ever today to stand up for tolerance and human rights at a time when racism and intoler@@ ance are raising their ug@@ ly heads and when the winds of xenophobia and anti @-@ Sem@@ iti@@ sm are being felt in ever more European countries .
She understands the situation better than most , perhaps , given that , being a Basque and a democra@@ t , she belongs to a category of Spanish and European people who , even now , have to fight against ultra @-@ nationalist terrorism to consolidate the fundamental rights which are the European Union &apos;s distingu@@ ishing marks .
The other five or ten countries coming into the European Union will demand structural funding for their countries .
Human rights , democracy and the rule of law are in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably linked to this , and this is why women should also be involved .
The gam@@ ble of implementing the European employment strategy through open coordination in recent years has started to pay off .
I agree with your sixth and tenth points .
The issue here is one of the government and the judiciary , but of the government and the security services .
Throughout this process , I have met with representatives from the Council and the Commission and consulted widely with the industry .
In the light of ever @-@ changing labour market developments , it is important for us to have en@@ qui@@ red about all kinds of new categories of employees which have been referred to in discussions for some time and in respect of which we would , in fact , like a definition of the terms employer , employee , self @-@ employed , self @-@ employed without staff , etc .
We have not done as the Commission said in every respect .
Let us , I said , have an athle@@ tics competition between school teams right across Europe in 2003 , at the end of which the competition &apos;s winners will be invited to Olymp@@ ia in 2004 , where the Olympic fl@@ ame is lit .
Sport is movement !
( The Minutes were approved )
At the end of a long process , may I thank once again our excellent rapporteur who has worked in a remarkable way , our sha@@ dows and everyone else involved .
I would now like to turn to category 3 , the internal policy measures , which are indeed wide @-@ ranging .
This message is conve@@ yed by highlighting the fact that , in the tri@@ angle that economists know well , in other words that formed by the volume of public debt , the volume of public revenue and the volume of public expenditure - whether this is current expenditure or , more importantly , investment expenditure referred to in this report - we must also take into account the level of public expenditure needed to achieve the objectives defined at Lisbon and also at Gothenburg .
It is apparently possible to build a T@@ GV to Dis@@ ne@@ yland but not to Strasbourg .
With cruel hum@@ our , we even bid these foreigners welcome in what we describe as an area of freedom , security and justice .
The approach proposed by the Commission involves a comprehensive policy which addresses all the issues - economic , social , political and humanitarian - and provides for close cooperation between government actions and initiatives of the social partners , the associations and local and regional authorities .
I think that enormous progress has been made on this issue .
First of all , with regard to the research programme , the Treaty and the texts relating to the Fifth Framework Programme are clear : the Commission has no legal competence in the field of specific military research as this field falls within the scope of intergovernmental cooperation and of the W@@ EU .
In this regard , we think that it is vitally important that the Stability Pact continues to be applied to all countries under the same conditions it has been applied up to now .
It goes without saying that the Commission is strongly committed to ensuring the success of the meeting in Madrid .
We then went further , and I agreed to put an oral amendment stating it should be &quot; adequate defence expenditure . &quot;
We failed to note that the weapons used by the Israeli army are weapons paid for by US taxpayers and that they have been used to destroy buildings and institutions belonging to the Palestinian Authority which are financed by European taxpayers .
Every day , for many weeks now , the International Red Cross , Amnesty International , Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères , the United Nations agencies , as well as the Israeli and European NGOs that are present on the ground have all been telling us and telling you , Mr Solana , that serious breaches of human rights and humanitarian law have been committed in occupied Palestine and that the conduct of the Israeli army is unacceptable .
Finally , we also need reasonable democratic control of documents covered by the second and third pillars .
What action does the Council intend to take in relation to the West African countries concerned and the c@@ ac@@ ao industry ?
All of this is no more than an idea , however , in the minds of our Justice and Interior Ministers and for the moment does not take any concrete form , and I believe it will take some time to come to fru@@ ition .
In order to do this , we propose that a mechanism should be retained , such as Article 30@@ 8 , but that it should be made to work in both directions : transferring competence to the Union or returning it to the Member States in the case of issues for which the national dimension has become pre@@ dominant once more .
The authority , indeed the moral obligation , to set up such a far @-@ reaching framework in the interest of economic welfare is provided by the Prin@@ ciples chapter of the EC Treaty , which lists among Union activities the adoption of an economic policy based on the definition of common objectives which can and must achieve , in particular , harmonious , balanced and sustainable development of economic activities , a high level of employment and sustainable , non @-@ infl@@ ationary growth , as well as social protection .
The public &apos;s perception of hunger is very often the tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ual one of fam@@ ine .
Mr President , our Rules of Procedure specifically state that the explanatory statement shall be the sole responsibility of the rapporteur .
As a rule , when fewer than 12 Members object to an oral amendment being accepted , it is deemed to be included in the vote .
Mr Posselt wishes to speak on the Rules of Procedure .
The Pap@@ ua leaders and the population think differently .
Although prepared to make a major effort to assist the population , we are fully aware of reports pointing to the government of Zimbabwe &apos;s use of the food crisis for political purposes .
Un@@ doub@@ tedly , the promised long @-@ term approach , setting multi @-@ annual catch targets , will be a major improvement and help to solve the problem of dis@@ cards .
Commissioner , you should make way for another Commissioner who is less parti@@ san , more open and aware of the needs of the fisheries sector , and who will bring forward measures that are compatible with genuine sustainable development .
If that is an alien concept to Mr Barón Crespo , then I am sorry for him .
A strengthened relationship will be in our mutual interest .
From a Commission perspective , these latter two points are su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous since the Council arrived at political agreement on them last April .
Mr President , my good friend and colleague Mr Dep@@ rez has overlooked the fact that today is not a particularly good day for Belgium either .
However , if the sentence on data retention is deleted from Amendment No 46 as proposed by the requested split vote , the whole compromise would un@@ ravel and this would surely lead to conciliation with an even more uncertain outcome .
Fourthly , a VAT level must be set which is harmonised at European level .
We have therefore agreed that from 2006 onwards the devices should continue to operate correctly for at least 30 000 km .
My last point has to do with the clause about the post @-@ 2007 assessment , which was mentioned in the proposal . We should think again about that as well ; otherwise , our approval of the Commission proposal is un@@ conditional .
The annual social reports must , of course , present a reliable picture of what has happened in this area , and that means that , in common with the financial accounts , they naturally must be subject to independent verification .
No one can have the sky to himself .
The Maghreb Union remains a pi@@ ous hope , however , with the creation of this Union encounter@@ ing a series of obstacles which , unfortunately , have not yet been overcome .
The human body is not a commodity .
The question of food labelling is of great importance , as many people have said this morning .
The solution is regulation by the law .
On the contrary , we think that these lists would only increase the isolation of the European Parliament from voters in the Member States .
In that way , the rich countries bear a large share of the responsibility for the problems of the developing countries .
The Spanish Presidency will keep up the pressure to the end and the Danish Presidency is also already prepared to take over on 1 July .
Nonetheless , while preparing the reports on the application of that directive , the Commission has been informed of existing problems and has highlighted them in a document which should be submitted to Parliament before summer .
I have a couple of supplementary questions .
I very much appreciate , however , that we perhaps must do more in the course of time to guarantee that everyone who particip@@ ates in the process is aware that , if a solution does not come about on a voluntary basis , the Commission has a mandate to act .
The procedure suggested by the rapporteur deserves our total support , because it is the best way of dealing with the loop@@ holes in the texts currently in force .
Firstly , we are proposing to improve and simplify European legislation by reviewing the whole cycle of the legislative process , beginning with the exercise of the right of initiative .
I take this opportunity to warn the Irish Government that it is following a very dangerous path .
After talks with the future Presidency , I hope that the road map originally devised by this House can be adher@@ ed to , because the political will is there .
Mr President , there is no doubt that , between them , the Council and Commission statements and Mr Brok &apos;s valuable work have painted a full picture of the enlargement process and the progress of the negotiations with the candidate countries .
I am sure that this new historic reconciliation , which is good news for all of us , will look to the future and that we shall all dis@@ miss the at@@ av@@ ism which has been flying around recently as a mere distra@@ ction of no importance whatsoever .
Madam President , every line of the important opinion of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedom and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , drafted so coura@@ ge@@ ously by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Ber@@ ger , is a matter of concern and frustration to us .
Gi@@ ving priority to SMEs is something we strongly support , and we hope that this will be implemented in forthcoming calls for proposals .
Nonetheless , here too , some positive developments are emerging now that Poland has withdrawn its demand for special rights of access , for example .
Mr President , I should first like to thank both the Presidency and the Commission .
Nevertheless , I want to emphasise certain aspects that worry us .
I agree that they represent a dam@@ ning indic@@ tment of the management of the Structural , Cohesion and IS@@ PA Funds .
Moreover , how can we know what the future holds and state with absolute certainty that the Member States or future Member States of the European Union are above any form of abuse ?
The flow of funds here is quite inadequate .
In the common position , just over half were accepted either as they stood or at least in spirit .
As a final point , I have stated in the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy that something needs to be done about whi@@ pl@@ ash , although this is not at all related to this issue , but rather to a safety issue which also ro@@ bs a huge number of people of their health .
Poland , the Czech Republic and Bulgaria want to use EU money to build motor@@ ways right across areas of outstanding natural beauty .
But child labour among children as young as 10 years old , as my colleagues have said , is increasing every year .
Its principal source of income is tourism , and of that it is currently deprived .
We must also clarify whether freedom of movement , the right to demonstrate and the right of assembly are now going to be undermined whenever European summits are held . If this were the case , it would constitute a serious threat to democracy and an unacceptable restriction on the right to protest and to express one &apos;s indi@@ gn@@ ation .
As we all know how difficult it is to reach Strasbourg , we understand all too well when our French fellow MEPs have difficulties with this too .
For all other roads , the Member States can determine themselves whether they wish to introduce driving bans .
You have heard the honourable Members and the Minutes state that they arrived late for reasons beyond their control , due in this case , to delayed flights , something which I am sure the Commissioner and the European Parliament will bear in mind .
Mr President , I should like to finish off with a comment on the F@@ ärm report .
We should develop rail transport and combined road @-@ rail transport as part of a European public railway service .
I , along with my fellow MEPs , will continue to be committed to offering genuine , objective and demon@@ stra@@ ble information to consumers who are truly given the freedom of choice .
We are worried about the fishing @-@ grounds - we know they are deple@@ ted - but , as you are well aware , we are leaving the sea in the hands of industrial fleets , who are the ones that do not respect biological rest periods , and whose nets we cannot monitor , as we do with small @-@ scale fishermen .
And what is the poor consumer supposed to do ?
It will be a matter for them to consider how to respond most appropriately in line with their own constitutional and legal frameworks .
Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Sch@@ mid for his work .
. ( NL ) The extent to which traffic offences in Europe are monitored in different ways is striking .
I have no hesi@@ tation in saying that .
( The House rose and observed a minute &apos;s silence )
There are perhaps two issues which are the most controversial amongst the various groups : the first is the levels of concentration of lead , c@@ admi@@ um , mercury and chro@@ mium present in packaging and the second is the particular percentage of recycling and recovery for each of the materials proposed .
I would like to draw your attention once again to the dangers of adopting an environmental indicator for packaging , as proposed by the change introduced by Amendment No 16 to Article 4 ( 3 ) ( a ) .
Te@@ ar down trade @-@ fortress Europe , put an end to European theft , which is only detrimental to the income of the poor farmers in this world .
The only genetically modified so@@ ya bean to be mark@@ eted internationally is already approved in the EU ; it is called Round @-@ up Re@@ ady , and is a genetic modification that we have approved in the EU under Directive 90 / 220 .
This anti@@ thesis between military air traffic control and its civil counter@@ part is something we should overcome .
I would like to thank Mr Be@@ y@@ sen for such a useful result having emerged from such lengthy considerations .
When you take advantage of this type of opportunity , you probably do not realise the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty of a phenomenon that is as economic as it is cultural .
We were convinced that in no way , shape or form would the Council ever agree to the flexibility instrument being used for Category 5 .
As the number of incidents of Cro@@ hn &apos;s disease increases , does the Commission support a recommendation that all pa@@ ste@@ ur@@ ised milk products in the Union require a minimum of 25 seconds of pa@@ ste@@ ur@@ isation in order to decrease the risks of bac@@ terium MA@@ P which is thought to be a trig@@ gering factor for Cro@@ hn &apos;s disease ? And if the Commission does not support this recommendation , why not ?
Could it outline the next steps leading up to the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union , together with the nine other applicant countries ?
I know that he asked to put a question .
Therefore , this document contains no modification of the Treaties .
Thank you Commissioner .
Last week President Bush was virtually paying court to Prince Band@@ ar bin Sul@@ tan , the representative of one of the most re@@ ac@@ tionary regimes on this planet .
Mr President , there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a vil@@ lain who has committed atro@@ cities against his own and the Kurdish people .
All countries must comply with international law , including Iraq and - lest we forget - the US .
They are now threatened with a full @-@ scale invasion by a so @-@ called Christian power , resulting in countless dead .
We must avoid wis@@ h@@ ful thinking and we must avoid du@@ cking the difficult questions which I have addressed during these remarks today .
Moreover , I should like to draw Parliament &apos;s attention to the fact that this report has been approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs by an overwhelming majority , with two votes against and two ab@@ sten@@ tions , and that normally speaking , this report would not have been discussed in the plenary had we applied the new procedure .
The Daphne programme is an effective instrument and it must be further developed .
I abstained , however , from voting on the legislative resolution , because I believe it is still necessary closely to observe the follow @-@ up given to this report in the legislative process .
That I consider to be a political error that takes inadequate account of the realities .
I would mention the first six meetings that are to take place under the Danish Presidency : the big AS@@ EM Meeting , the meetings of business leaders and of ministers of economic affairs , as well as the summits with Japan , China , South Korea and India which are all to take place in Copenhagen during the Presidency .
Although we can welcome the commitment to set up an assistance fund for natural disasters in the Union , we must certainly bear in mind the causes of this un@@ predictable weather .
If no such work is being done , then I would like to have those two hours back for the ur@@ gencies .
I also wish to thank the responsible Commission officials for their very helpful cooperation . I would also thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
In the UK this weekend there was a huge rally - Liber@@ ty and Live@@ lihood - where thousands of people gathered in London to protest at various problems relating to the countryside .
This is a policy of the Bureau as a whole and I think that , as we have just seen , we can make debates in Plen@@ ary even better than they have been in the past .
For these reasons , the proposed amounts represent a certain stability concerning the total amount , but with a re @-@ cent@@ ring of activities , a rec@@ ast of the cooperation programmes , and an intensi@@ fication of the actions in the area of asylum and immigration , including the external border control and the establishment of Eurojust .
( Applause from the left )
Employment is an important issue .
This may well be the most important point , for we are talking about simplifying procedures - and we have discussed this in the context of the resources to be earmarked for natural disasters too : it really is extremely difficult for our citizens , our businesses and our public administrations to use Community resources .
I would highlight the number of lines where we believe there is a need to strengthen existing schemes .
I am thinking , for example , of a World Environment Organisation .
On a less glo@@ om@@ y note , the Quartet reviewed the Palestinian reform process which seems to be on track in as much as this is possible under the current situation .
You did not even demand an end to the si@@ ege of President Arafat or the withdrawal of Israeli forces .
It will probably turn out that any code of conduct will be insufficient , and these rules will also have to be put on a legal footing .
Europe &apos;s voice often cannot be heard .
It should nonetheless be emphasised that the EU has in actual fact become one of the leading actors in the efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East .
Bio@@ fuels are a good way to improve the air quality in our cities , as well , and , above all , to diversi@@ fy the sources of energy supply .
Because we have considerably improved cars over the past ten , fifteen years .
This really sad@@ dens me , and it is something I have to say in the hearing of many members of the public .
This is shown once again in the case of Mar@@ tha And@@ reas@@ en .
Amon@@ gst my particular reservations , I would like to highlight the following three :
There is no point in repeating the list of shortcomings in the action plan adopted .
The concept of sustainable development st@@ ems from one need : to respond , through a solidarity which is mind@@ ful of the future , to the feeling of complexity and dependence which character@@ ises globalisation .
Privati@@ sing profits and nation@@ alising losses , that is what the &apos; Union &apos;s strategic and supportive commitment to the countries of Mercosur in relation to their economic and political integration projects ? , which the policy pra@@ ises , really looks like !
The USA has stated that it is determined to proceed with its attack on Iraq , its aim being to control the oil supply in the area and impose its su@@ prem@@ acy .
There are refer@@ enda to be won in the applicant states .
Mr Verheugen , as you said , you are asking for greater flexibility from the candidate countries with regard to financial problems .
As the chairman of the committee responsible , let me say that we are making preparations to shape the parliamentary procedure as spe@@ edi@@ ly as possible so that there is no delay on Parliament &apos;s part , and so that the date envisaged for the signing of the Treaties can be adher@@ ed to .
Madam President , allow me first to address a query to Mr Freder@@ ik@@ sen , who ch@@ aired his first Social Affairs Council yesterday .
I would like to give my wholehear@@ ted support to the rapporteur &apos;s proposals , and thus to those of the Committee on the Regions , as regards fixing the threshold at EUR 1 billion or 0.5 % of GDP .
The trade in emission rights at global level within the Kyoto Protocol is a system involving many risks .
En@@ lar@@ gement is stup@@ id , says Mr Barnier , because it multip@@ lies the risk of block@@ ages and therefore of weaknesses , but it will be ratified at the forthcoming Copenhagen Summit .
Now , dialogue between , on the one hand , the Committee on Budgets and , on the other hand , the committees and their rapporteurs for the budget takes place as a practically permanent process , beginning with the guidelines in the spring , including the new work carried out this year with special working groups to monitor this year &apos;s budget and extending to the amendments ahead of the first reading .
I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee on Budgets , the highly competent budget secretariat , the Pre@@ sidi@@ um , above all today &apos;s President and , finally , the Commission , the Council and , especially , a very pragmatic and proactive Danish Presidency .
However , if the proposal on the table for the financing of enlargement in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 is adopted , this ratio between the EU budget and European economic output , even with another ten members , will not again reach the level it stood at in the mid @-@ 1990s .
That said , I should like to refer to Parliament &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s budget .
Mr President , we would like to add three comments concerning the Budget at this reading .
However , a number of things are already clear .
I welcome the fact that this agreement will give Parliament a bit more power and that there is also going to be the opportunity to examine certain documents .
That , Mr Bon@@ de , is why this committee does not deal with any papers that have to do with legislation , in which area Mr Tur@@ co is talking about justice and internal affairs .
In this respect , I shall say to the Commission &apos; Commissioner , you cannot ask us to grant discharge within a short deadline as well as telling us that , for your part , you need time to take the decisions necessary for you to comply with Parliament &apos;s procedures .
At the European Council meeting , the Chairman of the Convention will inform the European Council of the status of the Convention &apos;s work , and the President of the European Parliament will also speak to the European Council .
I represent a fairly straightforward case - Slovenia - which would actually appear to be pretty representative of other small countries in the sense that , without the hard scho@@ oling from Europe , these countries would have been psych@@ ologically much , much further away from Europe than they are today .
That is why the Commission was right to insert safeguard clauses .
There is also a risk of information being with@@ held from small countries and small political groups .
I am in favour of the incorporation of the Charter into the treaty . On the other hand , I am against the line of reasoning that it is a prerequisite that the EU be a legal person in its own right or that the Charter would be a step along the way towards an EU state .
The EU did not stop at words .
These decisions have therefore been integrated into the European Union &apos;s prior regulatory framework , c@@ f. the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union , and both have been published in the Official Journal of 22 September 2000 .
Only cancell@@ ations for which the corresponding airline is responsible would be covered , however , because , obviously , in some circumstances , it would be unfair for the airline to bear sole responsibility .
Its cancellation , therefore , remains more topical than ever .
I have listened with great interest to what Mr García ? Marg@@ allo y Mar@@ fil has just said .
The vote will take place at 5.@@ 30 p.m .
The most recent low point was when the famous statue of King Gy@@ an@@ end@@ ra was blo@@ wn up in the middle of Pat@@ an , an area that I know well .
Secondly , we have already experienced a situation in which many MEPs , who are still with us , told this House that bar@@ ring Turkey from the customs union would inevitably drive it into the arms of the Islamic fundament@@ alists !
If anyone is to make political visits to Iraq at this time , then it should be international weapons inspectors and nobody else - and I say this with reference to the visit to Iraq of the provincial governor of Car@@ in@@ th@@ ia , Jörg Hai@@ der , which is his third , and is su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous and contrary to Austrian interests .
In order to prevent mistakes , we in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats are , in a motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups in the European Parliament , requesting , for this reason among others , that unlimited budget rights and full codecision should be transferred to this House for agricultural matters .
Many queries could be raised regarding the proposal for a progress report . However , given the time constraints , I will concentrate on the question that concerns me most as citizen of a southern European country , namely the so @-@ called de@@ coupling of aid .
So we and the Commission have time to reflect .
The latest general call for proposals for the European initiative on democracy and human rights illustrates our commitment . EUR 4@@ 2.6 million will be allocated to related projects in the 29 selected countries .
It seems that very little has been done to ensure the public &apos;s right to privacy within the European Union .
I am thinking not only of national public service television channels , but also local channels , whose value in terms of providing social interaction and restoring social links is indisp@@ utable .
I therefore agree with the position expressed by Mr Medina Ortega in the conclusion to his speech to the effect that , when we draw up the new version of the Treaties , we must reflect once and for all on the European Union &apos;s competences in this field .
It has not done any fav@@ ours - and in some cases has been discriminatory - to Irish fishermen .
That is no longer necessary in this case , as nearly all the chapters have already been opened .
At the end of the day , this is about getting the final result accepted in the Member States and the candidate countries , and so I will say quite clearly that the final package for every single candidate country must also come complete with a decent measure of gener@@ osity on our part .
Kem@@ al At@@ atur@@ k , who planned a modern state for the Turkish people , will be v@@ indicated once all the institutional reforms have been completed and implemented , once the military leadership obe@@ ys and exec@@ utes the decisions taken by the democratic political leadership in Turkey .
But there seems to be no good reason on safety grounds why closure should not take place in 2008 , rather than 2006 , if this would make a significant difference to Bulgaria &apos;s economic situation .
I commend Romania &apos;s progress to this House .
I wish to conclude by emphasi@@ sing that , in any case , the candidate countries deserve the greatest respect for the efforts they have made to date with accession to the EU in mind .
We should make this as un@@ complicated as possible for the people of the candidate countries .
It might also be in the interests of these countries to inform them that the legal systems in some of the 15 countries of the current Union are certainly not worthy of a democracy .
We would like the forthcoming IGC to have an outcome that contributes to solving all kinds of bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , such as codecision of Parliament and the Council , public access to the Council &apos;s legislative meetings , repe@@ al of the right of veto in the Council and the election of the President of the European Commission by the European Parliament or by the electorate .
Europe will in that way become more secure for future generations , and democracy will be stronger in our part of the world .
That is simply not the way to proceed .
I have in mind the very disappointing opinion adopted by the Council , by Co@@ re@@ per , on the issue of other forms of legislation .
What will happen at the end of 2003 if the Council does not manage to reach an agreement on the ethical issues relating to these hundreds of millions of euros in appropriations ?
They are already on the agenda for the spring European Council and we are already engaged with the Member States in clari@@ fying these initiatives , which we see as big and important .
I agree with that sen@@ timent but would add that this should be in accordance with scientific opinion and should take account of possible effects on animal health and welfare .
What will it do for me ?
The employers did not want this , however .
Finally , in particular where services of general interest are concerned - other Members have already commented on this - we want the Commission to at last get round to doing its job , as it has been saying it will for so long .
What is positive is the proposal to set up a common database col@@ l@@ ating the most important information per@@ taining to European financial institutions &apos; business data and making it accessible to the public .
On the contrary , we call on citizens to rise up against such a plan .
I have not yet been to Galicia - I am going tomorrow - but I am sure that one really needs to talk to the fishermen and sh@@ ell@@ fishermen in order to understand exactly the extent of the tragedy they are facing and their need for help , help which our Group is fully in favour of providing .
In principle , it is impossible to claim both these things at the same time .
The framework of budgetary implementation in 2001 outlined by this report is characterised by a very strong implementation of the budget , which in particular affects appropriations for the pre @-@ accession and Structural Fund programmes , due to ongoing shortcomings in Community accounting procedures , which need to be reformed as a matter of urgency , and also due to the persi@@ stence of long @-@ standing problems , such as the lack of transparency in the Commission &apos;s handling of the system of protection for the European sugar industry .
I have listened carefully to President @-@ in @-@ Office Haar@@ der and President Prodi .
Let us repeat ourselves , therefore , although it may be that , for once , it will not be necessary .
If any one country wants to hold out until the last possible moment , they do so at their own risk and not at the risk of all the other accession countries , because we must be prepared to agree as each country is prepared to agree .
My party &apos;s joint resolution with the GUE / NGL and Verts / ALE Groups calls for a common statute , agreed with national governments in the Council , giving equality of treatment to MEPs and transparency in our allowances .
It will be even worse if , the first time they go to the polls , voters in the new Member States at the same time read about debates on the Members &apos; Statute on the front pages of their newspapers .
Which region has the greatest natural fish and sh@@ ell@@ fish resources , that must be protected ?
It is not a case of more fishing , but of better fishing , monitoring resource conservation by means of total allow@@ able catches - which were designed for that purpose , as well as quotas and technical measures - selective fishing , biological recovery periods , the fishing effort , regulating days at sea , and also , with scra@@ pping , but as an additional measure , not the only one , because it is the only measure that is irre@@ ver@@ sible .
We have too many vessels ch@@ asing fewer and fewer fish , with some stocks in a state of total collapse .
I shall con@@ fine my comments to a few basic issues .
I fully support the Commission &apos;s proposal and it is fundamentally important that its content remains intact .
In terms of trade , the Union is already on an equal footing with the other leading players on the world stage . Why , then , can we not be equally credible in the political arena ?
I welcome the proposal to gener@@ alise the Community method , codecision and majority voting . I welcome the idea of a single spokes@@ man for foreign policy , who is part of the Commission but is personally accountable to the Council too .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjour@@ ned on Thursday , 4 December 2002 .
The time has come to call a sp@@ ade , a sp@@ ade , as you say yourself , and therefore to talk about European laws .
Not only will the Member States start to implement this - and we must monitor it carefully - but candidate countries are using as@@ best@@ os at a level we can only estimate , but it is quite a dangerous level .
The four conditions laid down in the 1999 framework directive are thus met .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that , at this jun@@ cture , over and above the measures which need to be adopted immediately , two things will be discovered which are more important than the race to adopt emergency measures , namely how the epidemic started and why it spread so quickly .
It is , however , for the control authorities in the Member States to ensure that legislation is fully and properly implemented and not , as Mr Sant@@ ini suggested , a function of the Commission to ensure that controls are in place .
We reject the fact that this pretext is once again being used so that public money can be employed to bol@@ ster private profits .
It is basically a question of supporting the efforts made within the framework of the European research policy , such as the promin@@ ence given to &apos; Women and Science &apos; as part of the specific programme entitled &apos; Struc@@ turing the European Research Area &apos; .
These early warning systems , once set up by the Commission , should benefit visi@@ bly from monitoring and increased control of their operation .
Mr St@@ en@@ mar@@ ck , for the other sections .
It has also been important to make a number of decisions during the year to cope with long @-@ term problems in category 5 .
It must be said that there have been a good deal of fir@@ sts in this budgetary process , not least because of the attitude of the Danish Presidency .
I would like to say sincerely to my colleague Mrs D@@ ühr@@ kop D@@ ühr@@ kop that we share her objectives , but not the methods or comments we have just heard here .
As regards the Commission &apos;s letter of amendment , I welcome the fact that the Commission has adopted some of Parliament &apos;s proposals from the first reading and , in particular that it is not making further cuts to export re@@ funds .
The fact that , in spite of this diversity of systems , we could agree on a set of common objectives proves that it makes sense to speak of a European social model .
I do not know where the honourable Member has got these ideas from , I do not get into these types of issues .
The Staff Regulation rules governing leave on personal grounds will be clarified by the reform amendments proposed by the Commission which , as the honourable Member will know , are currently before the Council .
I believe that it is particularly important to acknowledge the problem in the first instance .
As far as the third substance , dec@@ a@@ B@@ DE , is concerned , the Member States and the Commission , on the other hand , initially maintained their opposition to a ban .
It is important that national , regional or local political decision makers give some thought to how they can help small and medium @-@ sized undertakings over guarantees in the future .
The Commission &apos;s reports and recommendations will continue to be completely objective and im@@ partial .
Today we can safely say that the iron cur@@ tain has not only been lifted but has been disman@@ tled , packed up in its box and con@@ signed to the at@@ tic of history where it will serve to remind us of the hor@@ rors of the past .
I would particularly like to thank President Prodi for the way in which the Commission has again presented a range of proposals that point a way forward to possibly better and , at the same time , more democratic ways of governing , princip@@ ally indicating how the Council and Parliament can participate in law@@ making with equal rights .
Also to be welcomed is the idea , put forward in the Cri@@ tical App@@ rais@@ al , of developing a productivity index enabling increases in labour costs to be measured in relation to growth in productivity .
Although this must be our immediate concern , however , we also need to act immediately , urgently , to prevent any more disasters of this kind .
Here , we would like to pay tribute to the Belgian Minister - who , moreover , is one of the few remaining Greens - who was one of the very few people to support the package proposed by the Commission and to fight for it to be adopted in its entirety .
Commissioner , what we need from the Commission by April 2003 is a report deciding whether and , if so , how all these candidate countries should play their part in Europe &apos;s policy on safety at sea .
Because we must manage to strengthen , guarantee and safeguard all our co@@ asts and those of our neighbours and make progress in the international field .
Lastly , I am wholly of the opinion that we must provide special protection for minors .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , in a resolution , the European Parliament called for a framework directive on the safety of nuclear material and on the security of nuclear power stations .
Whilst condemning the procedure and making it abund@@ antly clear that this calendar of the Commission should not in any circumstances represent a precedent , I can recommend , on behalf of the coordinator of the Committee on Budgets , approval of the urgency .
. ( FR ) The outcome of the Copenhagen Summit has left a bitter taste in everyone &apos;s mouth .
As regards regional policy and the common agricultural policy taking account of mountain regions in future , I have already explained that regional policy and agricultural and rural development policy are indeed two policies that directly take account of mountain regions .
I would also like you to know that we firmly intend to work together to ensure that our areas , which have very well @-@ defined handi@@ caps , can be effectively protected .
It is all the more worrying , therefore , that the two Buddhist Tibet@@ ans , T@@ enz@@ in Del@@ ek and Lob@@ sang D@@ hon@@ du@@ p have now been sentenced to death .
I ab@@ h@@ or this , because by acting in this way , it has accepted things that are not found in any programme of any socialist party in any country .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in making out that it is a champion of human rights , the European Union tail@@ ors them to its needs .
Lastly , we hope there will be consul@@ tative committees , inquiry bodies and safety authorities . I have to say that personally I would be very worried if Amendment No 49 were carried , as this would destroy the entire proposal .
I would perhaps express this in even stronger terms : where rail is concerned we have probably not even started to make it a reality .
Imagine what this means in real life : trac@@ tors - and some are really very small - with ta@@ cho@@ graph@@ s , or the driver of a milk lor@@ ry , who goes from farm to farm and can no longer have his little chat ( rest period ) with farmer X because he has to respect a very particular sequence of driving times and rest periods , as if he were travelling from Rotterdam to Munich .
The low @-@ cost airlines based inside the EU , like Ry@@ an@@ air , Easy@@ jet , Virgin and German@@ wings have been ignored .
Maximum pressure should , of course , be brought to bear on Saddam via the Security Council , but we must also make every effort to prevent war .
Thir@@ ty million is starting to look more feasible in relation to the 100 million that make up the annual budget devoted to human rights .
When one is no longer as young and beautiful as you are , but , like me , is in one &apos;s se@@ venti@@ eth year , that sort of thing causes an enormous amount of an@@ gu@@ ish .
In short , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , as you yourself said , I came away with a sense of restra@@ ined satisfaction , but I had mixed feelings ; I was encouraged by the efforts being made to implement the Bonn Agreements under the a@@ eg@@ is of the international organisations , efforts which had brought significant progress ; but I was aware that the game was still far from being won ; and I was convinced , finally , that everything had to be done to establish the fragile authority of the provisional government by giving it the means to demonstrate its ability to improve the security and economic and social situation of the Afghan citizens everywhere in the country .
President Kar@@ z@@ ai &apos;s government continues to work through the transitional administration to promote stability , democracy and prosperity in Afghanistan .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is interesting to hear certain re@@ constructions of the facts which - quite rightly - merely sk@@ im the surface of the present , while totally overlooking or pre@@ tending to overlook the past , the Taliban past , or , as in other contexts , while critic@@ ising the actions which may lead to war in Iraq and forgetting the thousands , the hundreds of thousands of people mass@@ ac@@ red , tor@@ tured and ex@@ termin@@ ated under Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime .
They do have a difficult job .
That has succeeded ; congratulations to Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt who negotiated so excell@@ ently .
Please let me conclude by again saying &apos; thank you &apos; - that is why I wanted to say a final word .
It will be about many countries that will now be Member States and the neighbours will be different .
It is also part of the Bank &apos;s political mandate to promote , across the full range of its activities , environmentally sound and sustainable development .
This leads me to recall a few of the E@@ BR@@ D &apos;s convic@@ tions , which it has acquired over ten years of experience , that the market economy cannot work without democracy , that the market economy cannot work without social cohesion , that there cannot be social cohesion without a strong civil society and that there cannot be strong civil society without transparency and fighting corruption .
That concludes voting time .
The din can cause permanent damage to the ear b@@ ones , and brain and lung ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
Therefore , following the discussions held in November in the Council , the Ministers agreed that we need to maintain our humanitarian assistance , including food aid .
Let us wait and see how that debate develops before taking a position on it .
In the event , the United States did go the UN route last autumn , and secured a unanimous vote for a tough Security Council resolution .
I therefore , Mr President , call upon the Council , working together with the other European institutions , to concentrate on creating a climate of more ser@@ ene cooperation between the countries of the Union , so that we can unite in an agreement and address the increasingly serious problems before us every day together .
But it is also clear that the European Union is not a major participant in the affairs of that region .
They have a pain threshold .
A financial declaration agreed by the three institutions speci@@ fies that EUR 42 million is to go to the global fund and the remaining EUR 3@@ 8.@@ 35 million to the programme for action .
&apos;@@ condem@@ ns in the strongest terms the execution of the Tibetan Lob@@ sang D@@ hon@@ du@@ p on 26 January for alleged political crimes and calls for the immediate setting aside of the death sentence on the Buddhist l@@ ama T@@ enz@@ in Del@@ ek &apos; .
After bloo@@ dy wars with more than two million cas@@ u@@ alties in the N@@ DR@@ C and hundreds of thousands in Rwand@@ a and Burundi , the fighting continues .
It is impossible to evaluate human suffering .
I believe the choice is rather between growth of profit alone and justice , on the one hand , the growth of speculative bub@@ bles , the &apos; En@@ ron &apos; economy and , on the other , more re@@ distribu@@ tive growth that takes account of social inclusion : an economy at the service of mankind .
That is such a small sum of money that it does not even meet the basic requirements of international human and fundamental rights .
Mr President , I am amaz@@ ed and sad@@ dened that this matter should be back up for discussion .
Consequently , Mr Franz Fischler and I have always made it our business to ensure the Union pul@@ ls its weight in negotiations on agriculture .
We have also got to make sure there are safeguards , because in encouraging third country nationals into the EU we must also make certain that we are not depri@@ ving those countries of the very important key workers that they need to help them develop .
I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Mar@@ set Cam@@ pos , for his excellent preparatory work .
Russia is particularly well @-@ placed to get a foot in the door because of their mutual economic links .
Mr President , first of all , I feel in many respects that I should be taking second place to the honourable Member , Mr Salaf@@ ran@@ ca Sánchez @-@ Ne@@ y@@ ra , in discussing this subject , because he has played such an important role in achieving what we are discussing today .
There are many other examples .
If there is one country which should understand the arguments for the International Criminal Court , as the honourable Member and I would agree , it is Chile .
Because the solution that is now being proposed consists of a combination of quotas , bans and charges , the majority of my group will still give it the benefit of the doubt for 2004 , but the problem cannot be solved without building a railway tunnel under the Brenner Pass .
If we are now to discuss the extension of a derogation , it must be clear to us that one does not simply maintain the status quo for another three years , so that the decision we are about to take must envis@@ age the derogation coming to an end by 2006 at the latest .
We are trying to achieve better coordination of the various instruments available to us .
In the light of this latest evidence , will you agree to review once again this damaging directive before it does more damage to employment prospects throughout the European Union ?
Another odd proposal is that of freezing the share of the market enjoyed by the different transport modes at 1998 levels .
The basic principles are excellent , but when it comes to the implementation of the applications , such as e @-@ health , e @-@ government and e @-@ learning , then it is shame@@ ful to see what is actually happening .
The mobile phone industry is a major employer representing the cutting edge of innovation .
In the EU we have prescribed exact limits for radiation which are lower than WHO standards .
by applying strict , stringent controls to the Iraqi dictatorship and , at the same time , maintaining and strengthening the international alliance against terrorism .
The Lisbon document raises a large number of issues , some of which do , but most of which do not , fall within the jurisdiction of the European Union , and for these we have the fine term &apos; open coordination &apos; .
Over recent years , it has emerged that France , for example , does not , in general , want to have anything to do with the commitments it entered into in 2000 .
In particular it will involve evaluating the efforts made by the Member States and by the European Union in education , training and also research and development .
However , Mr President , the labour market and welfare systems are two sides of the same coin : if one goes well - the labour market - then so does the other - welfare systems - given that the labour market finances welfare systems and vice versa : if the labour market does not go well , then neither do welfare systems , and Commissioner Sol@@ bes starts to have problems .
There is a second aspect that seems to me to be of great importance .
I think that now , of all times , we need to testi@@ fy in strong support of the value of the European model , not only as a market , but especially as a model for well @-@ being , sustainability , development , and the prosperity which is tied up with well @-@ being .
Thank you , President Prodi , for your encouraging and optimistic message .
We fully support the railways within the Union &apos;s transport system and call for top priority to be given to urgent changes to the terms governing its expansion , nature and adjustment to market conditions .
I sincerely hope , therefore , that , next Monday , that voice of the vast majority of the European population re@@ sounds in the heads and hearts of the European Heads of Government , too .
We have to be united in accepting that those serious consequences will follow .
Mr President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , the annual debate on an area of freedom , security and justice must be seen against the broader backdrop of the progress that has actually been made in the course of the last year , as a result of the commitment of the successive Spanish and Danish Presiden@@ cies .
In France , the so @-@ called &apos; internal security &apos; bill drawn up by the Minister for Internal Affairs targets a whole range of actions : the illegal installation of travellers , the holding of meetings in the entrance halls of blocks of flats , aggressive beg@@ ging , so @-@ called &apos; passive or active &apos; solic@@ iting , explicitly aimed at foreign pro@@ stitutes , and all these things constitute offences which attract heavy fines and , in some cases , prison sentences .
We are inv@@ ading the traditional sovereign borders of the Member States , a fact that cannot be ignored or played down .
They are not right method@@ ologies .
The European continent shows the general characteristics of a region located in the planet &apos;s northern h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere and has forests with highly differentiated con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous and non @-@ con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous species which reflect the regional biodiversity and bio @-@ climatic wealth of the old Europe .
It is therefore very odd that the same committee in the same report should also have accepted a number of amendments in quite the opposite v@@ ein .
I therefore think that it is courageous and comm@@ end@@ able that the rapporteur has managed to keep both feet on the ground .
The passport should be signed by the doctor and the patient before the operation as a clear declaration of consent .
In 1992 , the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary , examining 11 000 women , reached the same conclusions .
It is in fact very clear to me that one of the results of development is a lasting improvement in the health and well @-@ being of populations .
Their aim is to achieve maximum profitability , without worrying about the social or environmental consequences .
The Commission has furthermore viewed with great concern the campaign of intim@@ id@@ ation that has been going on against a great number of critical media in Kazakhstan .
Yet again we find ourselves having to discuss Zimbabwe .
However , the most urgent issue at this moment relates to action to be taken by the EU itself .
I call upon Members to support the resolution without amendment .
My group can support the Commission &apos;s offer to exclude the health sector , the social sector and the education sector from an offer , but I would also like clarification on the situation with regard to universities .
Cri@@ tics are concerned that , in this field , countries are seen as growth areas subject to market mechanisms and capable of developing their own dynamics going far beyond what was originally laid down .
They have not said that up to now .
And , just as an airport would be in chaos if it had various air traffic control companies , in a port there must only be one pil@@ otage service and one mo@@ oring service and self @-@ handling must not be allowed , and would only be acceptable if it were carried out by regular seaf@@ aring crew who furthermore are duly qualified and have sufficient knowledge to ensure that safety is not jeopardis@@ ed .
I now wish to say something about the various budget head@@ ings ; starting with heading 1 , agriculture .
The contribution of the Member States must be appropriate and in proportion to the objectives that the European Union wishes to achieve .
.
It is always a matter of balance between , on the one hand , greater flexibility , and , on the other , long @-@ term security .
The strategy for employment has undeni@@ ably contributed to reducing unemployment , but we are today facing a different scenario , with Europe &apos;s economy in a period of stag@@ nation , a situation to which the Member States must pay particular attention .
Of course , I have to admit there is another side to this coin . A hard core of 7.@@ 4 % of the unemployed have never actually worked , have lost their job , or face major obstacles in getting back into work .
Any reform of the Central Bank must comply with four conditions . Firstly , decisions have to be taken quickly and efficiently .
It is clear that the current members of the club have presented a proposal which , first and foremost , aff@@ ords themselves and their prerog@@ atives some protection against the prerog@@ atives of the members who will join the club in the future .
The history of the European Union does not provide a single example of an alliance of L@@ illi@@ pu@@ ti@@ ans against the Gul@@ li@@ vers of Europe .
He has contributed to a good debate and I thank him for this .
Her@@ ein lies another reason not to alter these values by taking imp@@ ru@@ dent action which would undermine them .
Naturally , it should also be possible - as , by the way , it is in the case of MEPs &apos; pension fund - for capital to be paid out as a lum@@ p sum at retirement age , without its being prescribed what , specifically , the capital is to be used for .
I want to ask two questions .
This is where Europe has an important part to play .
The cause it suggests is the &apos; rigi@@ dity of the European economy &apos; , which prevents it from &apos; re@@ acting swiftly to external shocks &apos; .
De@@ aling care@@ lessly with the privacy of our citizens jeopardis@@ es the basic trust of the people in their government and in the constitutional state and then we are worse off .
This request is , I think , indic@@ ative of the region &apos;s interest in moving towards Europe and of the importance which the European Union has acquired .
I do not think , however , that systematically implementing the principle of preference for women candidates for positions of leadership is a suitable alternative , as long as this imbalance persi@@ sts .
Con@@ fi@@ dence is the engine of economic growth .
It proposes that &apos; the number of govern@@ ors with voting rights should be lower than the total number of govern@@ ors with a seat on the Govern@@ ing Council of the ECB &apos; and wishes to introduce a rotating system to determine who votes and when , which would mean the govern@@ ors of the central banks losing their permanent voting rights , would introduce criteria of represent@@ ati@@ veness based on the size of the country &apos;s financial sector and volume of GDP , and a system that will always ensure the presence of the major powers to the detriment of the smaller countries .
Mr President , in the light of these events I would urge that the aid to Cambodia from the European Union must not be allowed to be un@@ conditional and that our representatives in Ph@@ nom Pen@@ h must put explicit pressure on the Cambo@@ dian Government to make every effort to improve the human rights situation in their country .
Is there any objection to the application of this oral amendment ?
Will they pursue battles with other ro@@ gue states ?
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking you for holding this debate , this extraordinary sitting .
The Kur@@ ds in Northern Iraq fear permanent occupation .
This crisis has proved the sen@@ sel@@ ess@@ ness of the European Union , tor@@ n apart by the opposing positions of its members , and has also proved that with average @-@ sized powers and unable to become a major power , it is possible to create an organisation with no power at all .
Yet when Saddam Hussein draws the men@@ ac@@ ing s@@ word of Islam and proc@@ laim@@ s Ji@@ had , it is we Europeans who will be his direct , closest target .
Civil aviation , tourism and other economic sectors will suffer on account of the climate of insecurity and the speculative explosion in the price of certain raw materials , particularly oil .
My group therefore believes the war must cease immediately .
And it is up to us .
Mr President , the war being w@@ aged against Iraq is an imperi@@ alist war .
I am speaking now , however , as the spokes@@ person for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets and , as such , I welcome the Commission &apos;s assurances regarding the cost of reforming the staff regulations of the European Civil Service .
Then there is the cost . In Europe we have still not properly added up what the use of pesticides actually costs society .
Finally , the point which raised more questions for our delegation than any other concerns Natura 2000 .
The debate is closed .
The research programmes should not just focus on the development of new drugs , but also on the question as to the simpl@@ est way to administ@@ er those drugs .
G@@ ér@@ ard has worked quickly but he has not been slo@@ ppy or care@@ less .
In my view , there is also a difficulty on the legal base .
There is currently no legal institution competent to carry out en@@ quiries within the Community bodies , due to the lat@@ ters &apos; privileged status .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs The@@ ato on the report which I supported in the Committee on Budgetary Control and which I also expect to support in this plen@@ um .
The amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission - there is not a very long list - are Amendments Nos 16 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 37 , 39 , 53 , 55 and 63 .
( EL ) The Greek Presidency of the Council maintains that it is making a qu@@ antum leap forward in order to overcome major differences within the European Union over Iraq .
As I pointed out previously during the work on the Commission &apos;s first communication , particular emphasis has been placed on the role of teachers as a channel enabling the development of digital liter@@ acy in our schools .
My third point is that it is not only about quantity but also about quality .
I also welcome all the amendments that are intended to foster a critical engagement with the instrument of the Internet , not only on the part of school pupils , but also on the part of their teachers .
In the previous discharge report , the Bureau and the Secretary @-@ General were asked to publish a study on this .
The Commission will present the Committee on Budgetary Control with a list of these contacts at a forthcoming meeting and suggest how we may take scrutiny further .
We must prepare the citizens of Europe and partner third countries to live and work in a society where knowledge is an imperative , strengthen the attraction of Europe as a centre of excellence for higher education and , la@@ stly , increase mutual understanding between peoples and cultures through exchanges and structural cooperation .
One of them recognised me and said : &apos; Mr Fat@@ u@@ zzo , at last I have met you !
Mr Pir@@ ker , you said a few minutes ago that if you voted in favour of this report , you would be against the health of our young people .
But let us be clear : are we not today acknowled@@ ging the failures of these three international conventions , the first of which is 40 years old ?
The rapporteur must be given credit for having c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly hidden her real message behind technical nu@@ ances of meaning .
The attempts to leg@@ alise drugs constitute a serious infringement of the UN Convention on Dru@@ gs and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , especially Article 33 of the latter .
Mr President , I want to begin by comm@@ enting very briefly on the time frame .
I share the view of my J@@ S@@ B colleagues that this is acceptable . &apos; - i.e. that we trust the guys .
A number of reports by Parliament have , over and over again , demanded real Parliamentary control of Europol , but to date nothing has happened .
Why not ?
The European Union deals with internal concerns by rene@@ wing its institutional framework , especially in the sense of extending the process of European integration .
In voting , we want , on the one hand , to he@@ al the sc@@ ars on the body of the old Europe , which , as has been said , are the terrible consequence of war .
Mr President , today , in this House , we are witnessing an act of moral justice : European countries , countries which are just as European as those which are already part of the Union but which , by a tw@@ ist of fate , found themselves , through no fault of their own , on the wrong side of an artificial line drawn across our continent , are coming back to Europe , coming back to us .
And with the same conviction we shall pursue the di@@ alogues that still need to be conducted , whether they relate to the B@@ ene ? decre@@ es , to nuclear power stations like Tem@@ elin or to other power stations , secure in the knowledge that the pursuit of this dialogue benefits both sides , for enlargement is not a zero @-@ sum game .
The most recent position adopted by the Budget Council is evidence of a completely opposite trend and is to be deplo@@ red .
En@@ lar@@ gement will also allow the European Union to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation . The Union will bring universal values to bear whilst remaining true to its historical duty to all the countries of the Mediterranean basin .
I believe that it is at least as important that these countries are being subjected to a neoliberal acquis , that public services are breaking down and large sections of the population are being condemned to the long @-@ term perpet@@ u@@ ation of the poverty that has arisen over the past ten years .
In the meantime , no change to the existing legal position has been either made or announced as a result of the President &apos;s statement .
The least that these serious and now univers@@ ally acknowledged problems require is that we do not make them worse .
Hop@@ efully , it will be possible to unite the EU in de@@ vising the common policy now that the people in the centre of Bag@@ h@@ dad are re@@ jo@@ icing at Saddam Hussein &apos;s fall and also trying to bring his giant statue cra@@ shing to the ground .
The question of Mr Er@@ kel was raised by the Greek amb@@ assador to Moscow during his meeting with the Russian dep@@ uty foreign minister , Mr T@@ si@@ zo@@ v , on 14 January .
The proposal made in this respect , as I understand it , takes this approach and I am certain that the Commission could assess it and evaluate it in its proposals for the employment guidelines .
A series of amendments aimed to limit the use of certain types of cells , such as cells derived from cloning or abortion .
I must stress that , as well as seeking to make the rules proposed more usable , functional and cohe@@ sive , we took care to pursue two further objectives .
The demand for bio@@ degra@@ d@@ ability definitely constitutes an important part of this legislation , but the requirement should be for this to be laid down in an actual article rather than in an annex .
I myself have been happy to follow the line taken by my own group &apos;s shadow rapporteur , my colleague Karl @-@ Heinz Florenz .
The proposed directive will accordingly introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community .
ACP countries also have very high levels of access to the EU market under existing agreements , and access will increase under the Cotonou Agreement .
We must also recognise and fight against the discrimination experienced by indigenous and pe@@ as@@ ant women .
We know that there are countries in Europe where it gets very hot , and others that need a lot of heat , some need@@ ing cooling down and others need@@ ing warming up , so that there are very different interests at play here .
If this is the case , Commissioner , you have a European energy policy in mind and , as long as you continue to develop it , this Parliament will support you , because it fulfil@@ s objectives which we all wish to achieve : increasing our competitiveness , guaranteeing the well @-@ being of all Europeans and greater economic growth .
. ( ES ) Mr President , it is a pleasure for me to take the floor today on behalf of my colleague , Commissioner Bus@@ quin , and on behalf of the Commission .
After all , the question then arises as to whether this is affordable or insu@@ rable for the economic sectors or whether it will remain inc@@ al@@ cul@@ able for them .
Mr President , in January 2002 , the Commission finally reached , with this proposal for a directive , the end of a process which had lasted for ten years .
So why does this House , and my group too , find itself so very divided over an issue about which everyone seems to agree ?
We must also have joint travel advice because there certainly is something the matter .
The Parliament mentions a number of points in this regard , including in particular the enlargement of the administrative capacity of the Member States .
I know , as the Commissioner said , that the regional authorities have not yet sent the Commission a report on this disaster and I know that this report will reach the Commission very soon , but I wanted to note now what has been said about the programming reserve and I also wanted to note the willingness demonstrated by the Commission to adopt measures for the agricultural sector .
Having accepted the urgent need to reform the Commission &apos;s accounting system along the lines suggested by its former Chief Ac@@ coun@@ tant , Mar@@ ta And@@ reas@@ en - who was in post just four months and working in what was supposedly a hostile environment - and with your understanding , as Commissioner for Reform , that reforms often take longer than expected to deliver , conc@@ eive , plan and actually put into action , surely now you can accept that it is time to stop vic@@ tim@@ ising Mar@@ ta And@@ reas@@ en and stop these ridiculous disciplinary proceedings against her .
My question is whether the Commission would be willing to direct resources specifically to programmes for the vocational training and social re@@ integration of UN@@ IT@@ A ex @-@ comb@@ at@@ ants and for these programmes to be monitored by both sides .
I also have to say in relation to this that I cannot commend the Council for the way in which it simply changed the legal basis , and , when forwarding the new text to Parliament , did not even think it necessary to explain why this change had been made and on what arguments it was actually founded .
At the present stage , the al@@ lied forces are responsible for consolidating security and providing humanitarian aid with the presence of Member States of the European Union ; however , the assistance and support of the international community as a whole are needed for there to be a fast , efficient and operational return to nor@@ mal@@ cy .
If we had had qualified majority voting on the Iraq issue , neither the British nor the French policy would have obtained majority support .
We MEPs who were in Bag@@ h@@ dad and Bas@@ ra witnessed this in particular .
In this quite sur@@ realistic debate , I should like , moreover , to draw attention to a most outstanding contribution by my fellow country@@ man and fellow MEP , Mr And@@ reas@@ en from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , who is closely associated with the Danish Prime Minister .
These requests must be put to the IMO by the Member States that are most directly involved and most prepared to take action .
There is no doubt that , in theory , as regards the idea of new momentum , for example , there is the goal of closer relations .
Moreover , we are silent on the issue of Chechnya .
It is essential to have that commitment now , at a time when the nuclear industry is saying that nuclear power can be good for Kyoto and good for the environment .
The hundreds of an@@ gry letters and e @-@ mails were signals of the human and institutional tragedy .
I thank him and colleagues who were on the temporary committee for the first year .
To put it bl@@ un@@ tly , we were disappointed with our partners &apos; priorities , on both education and health , in the planning of what we are doing country by country .
The stability and credibility of the Union &apos;s economy and its single currency are at stake .
He forces himself to administ@@ er one of the po@@ tions , namely the six@@ teenth , recommended by the good doctors of Brussels .
I am wholeheartedly committed to the central importance of the European Central Bank &apos;s objectives . In Germany , the largest Member State in the monetary union , it would be a great mistake if we tried to address our acute problems through the simple but extremely dangerous strategy of taking on further debt and raising taxes .
I leave it to you to be the judges of the possible legal and political consequences of this .
Firstly , the German translation of recital A is incorrect , so please use the English version here .
In the early stages of the outbreak of S@@ ARS in Asia , I understand that the Tai@@ wan@@ ese authorities could get very little information from the Chinese , which allowed the virus to spread rapidly across the region .
Let me refer to what was said by my colleagues Mr Mann and Mr Cas@@ aca with reference to the cooperation agreements and our association agreements .
Reports of harassment of Christians in Vietnam , especially the Monta@@ gn@@ ards and H@@ mon@@ g Christians , have increased since the violent u@@ pris@@ ing in the Central High@@ lands in 2001 , in which some religious groups were re@@ porte@@ dly implic@@ ated .
There is enormous mass action going on , there has been te@@ ar @-@ g@@ assing of people , at least one person has been killed .
These have to do with the way in which the definition of cross @-@ border flow is being changed to refer to regulated zones instead of to the borders of the Member States .
We certainly need to identify new social action programmes and , above all , we need to concentrate on protecting people with disabilities as well as new forms of cooperation concerning the protection of children .
The debate is closed .
This amendment on the overall reduction in the tax burden is incompatible with the one they have tabled on the stability pact and it also concerns an area of responsibility that is reserved for the Member States themselves .
If I fail and they lose that amendment , I again would appeal to the PPE @-@ DE Group to pull back and not reject this package .
I have in mind specific ideas , such as the commitment to more and better jobs . These should be jobs in which flexibility and stability need not threaten workers &apos; rights .
There is also the idea of making social policies such as those on accidents in the workplace horizontal .
Mr President , I am going to use the time allocated to Mr An@@ dri@@ a and Mr Man@@ to@@ van@@ i too , who have asked me to express their regret because they have been detained in Italy by strikes and other such serious matters .
Mr President , Mr Vitorino said at the beginning of this debate that it is important and sensitive legislation .
The next item is the vote .
Although this sort of approach could , in principle , constitute one element of a compromise , we must bear in mind that various interpretations of differing content are given to the term partial de@@ coupling .
I am talking about Galicia , but I am not only referring to my own country ; I am talking about countries that need their milk quota to be increased , countries that could provide for their internal markets without calling European balances into question .
They concern problems arising from the 2002 reference period in the Commission &apos;s report .
That is fine by me .
Subject : EU senior citizens &apos; card
Once again , therefore , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Sj@@ öst@@ edt , for his efforts .
There is clearly something wrong here , technically speaking .
I would also like to condemn the conc@@ eit of the Commission , which takes decisions behind the backs of the sector , the lack of communication between scientists and fishermen and I agree with him that none of this helps in promoting a credible image of Europe amongst our citizens .
The time available for this debate is limited , and the issues dealt with by these three reports are very important .
One is the economy .
Mr President , I voted in favour of the Tur@@ mes report .
It should not be possible , in a liber@@ alised internal market , for nuclear energy to have a special status and not to be subject to competition law .
According to data provided by the European Commission , it is possible to comply with the Kyoto Protocol by implementing measures co@@ sting less than EUR 20 per ton@@ ne of CO2 .
As far , then , as the question of a peaceful solution to the differences is concerned , a change in the atmosphere of Greek @-@ Turkish relations has already been noted in various sectors .
The People &apos;s Mu@@ jah@@ e@@ deen &apos;s den@@ unci@@ ation of the Iranian regime &apos;s secret nuclear weapons programme in August 2002 has been proved completely correct , namely by independent research institutions , and therefore the public den@@ unci@@ ation by the same organisation on 15 May of the Iranian regime &apos;s programme of an@@ th@@ ra@@ x production was naturally viewed with general acceptance by the international media .
If we believe efficiency to be contradictory to democracy , or flexibility or transparency contradictory to the responsible involvement of Parliament , then this - in my opinion - is indeed a sad reflection on our own shortcomings .
Why is it mainly men who are involved in club and association structures , even though more and more women are becoming members ?
The fight against breast cancer must be a health policy priority and the Member States must draw up effective health policies and strategies to ensure better early detection , diagnosis and treatment .
That would be a proactive response to Mrs J@@ ön@@ s &apos; call for a conference .
That is why I feel that it should indeed be linked with the Sixth Framework Programme for research and the EUR 400 million dedicated to cancer research .
The Commission reforms will put us in a strong position when we sit around the table at the WTO talks in Cancun .
The June Movement wishes to see the aid completely done away with and is unable to support a re@@ distribution of the aid whereby new areas are brought under the umbrella of aid arrangements of one kind or another .
We think that we should be more realistic , and not under@@ estimate the profound differences between Turkey and Europe .
Only the day before yesterday , my parliamentary group drew up an initiative on the situation in Turkey , in which various human rights organisations were involved .
We cannot even manage to enforce a travel ban in respect of our own institutions .
Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr M@@ éndez de Vigo and Mr Hän@@ sch .
What we feel was missing , Mr President , and is likely to continue to be missing is a vision from a global perspective of the imperative need to make determined , innovative changes to the functioning and competences of a genuine United States of Europe .
The EU must increasingly work in partnership with the Americans , and not in opposition to them .
In 46 of the 49 major conflicts since 1990 , weapons of this kind were used .
The proposals and strategy he set out for us here today seem to be moving in the right direction .
This is the thin end of the w@@ edge , however .
We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demo@@ s , a real public space for the citizens of Europe .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists - and I should make this clear - supports the Action Plan presented by the Commission , which should be implemented with the utmost regard for the special characteristics of the Mediterranean .
That is the case in Catalonia and , I would say , in all the Catalan regions .
The Cohesion Fund , like the other Structural Funds and the remaining Community policies , should continue along these lines .
I therefore argue that , in view of the recent mining accidents , it is fundamental that these amendments should be included in the scope of the S@@ ev@@ eso II Directive .
- ( FR ) We voted against the Ter@@ r@@ ón i Cus@@ í report on the Community immigration policy because it constitutes , in both form and content , an example of one of the most disastrous products of the European Parliament .
. ( PT ) The essential problem of developing countries with regard to energy - in contrast to the situation in more developed countries - is not the replacement of current production sources with other , less poll@@ uting ones .
This might be a ra@@ sh of patri@@ otic enthusiasm or the flag might be just hanging out to dry .
Under Danish criminal law , section 2@@ 26 b of the Danish Criminal Code , it is an offence to make statements con@@ stit@@ uting der@@ is@@ ory and humili@@ ating treatment of a group of people .
I hope they are right in saying this , as we could all do with a sp@@ urt of growth under present circumstances .
The protection of businesses from disproportionate costs is surely vital and the attempt which has been made to ste@@ er this text towards a more balanced approach effects what I believe is the long @-@ term security for this market .
I am ready , as always , to debate further this interesting issue with Parliament through answers to questions , though in respect of the real aim of public procurement rules , as interpreted and confirmed by the European Court of Justice .
We now have a good spr@@ ing@@ board for entering the WTO negotiations , and I expect our international partners - who are always lec@@ turing us - to match our commitment and do their part too , for they too must do their part .
Our job now is to formulate a more precise strategy of this kind for the European Union .
The exac@@ ting provisions contained in the reports by Mr Tra@@ kat@@ elli@@ s and Mrs Sch@@ e@@ ele will enable us to as@@ certain the composition of foods , to follow their distribution route and to know whether or not animals have e@@ aten GMO @-@ based feeds .
It will lead to every country having optimum recycling capacity because every material producer will have an interest in recycling .
Just as the rapporteur stated , economic and ecological factors must be taken into consideration in this connection .
This always creates uncertainty , resistance to change , apparent winners and lo@@ sers and there is no doubt that this can be argued over , but I believe there are many more arguments to convince us , and to convince us that we are moving in the right direction , and to confirm that Europe , by means of directives such as this , is consolidating its determination to lead the process of achieving sustainable development .
It has been said several times here that after the first reading it was difficult to believe that we would get this far , that we would have a directive on emissions trading available to us whose content is sensible and rational in a way that makes it possible to be accepted from very different points of view .
The Commission must then however exclude any form of capacity expansion or subsi@@ dis@@ ation from the structural funds , otherwise it is just ban@@ ging your head against a brick wall .
There are a number of matters of particular concern to us this year , for example , outstanding commitments .
We believe that Thessaloniki has been a very important step .
What , indeed , would be the use of this would @-@ be constitution which , whether it be a source of delight or indi@@ gn@@ ation , is a considerable leap forward in the direction of European sovereignty , if our continent were to end up becoming the hand@@ ma@@ iden of the US empire ?
All these must be addressed with the greatest attention and utmost caution .
In a virtual , ideal world , Mrs Cor@@ bey would have had my support and I might even have been b@@ older than she has been .
Those who , in this area , adopt a defensive and protectionist position do not recognise the strengths and competitive advantages that the European Union possesses .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make two points about the strategy we should pursue at Cancun in September .
We are familiar with all the technical proposals .
I feel that the Council &apos;s proposal , which is the result of a lab@@ orious compromise , does not offer us the necessary clarity in this case either and runs the risk of considerably complic@@ ating communication with passengers .
Since then , the car has claimed a large proportion of these for driving and parking .
But we need instruments to achieve that , and this point is addressed to you personally , Commissioner Sol@@ bes Mir@@ a : please work within the Commission to ensure that we finally get the directive under Article 13 , which relates to discrimination on grounds of gender , which will at last give us a significant instrument .
After all , democratisation and prosperity cannot be seen in isolation from one another .
I received a complaint that I would like to pass on to the Commissioner and all the members of the delegation for relations with that country .
In this regard , I would point out , in passing , that the need for geographic mobility on the part of workers , often defended by the European Union , should be strongly qualified in order better to preserve , wherever possible , the social and family link .
This really is a structural problem , because it is a question of attitude . People simply do not wish to go and work in inland regions .
I must emphasise one point in particular . It concerns our development indicators .
This would prevent the un@@ natural fragmentation of the European aviation market and ensure that the many bilateral agreements are con@@ signed to the scra@@ p he@@ ap from now on .
Nonetheless , it is important to bear in mind criticisms made in the House and by the Court of Auditors . We therefore believe that even in the case of minor adjustments , the principles of good governance , transparency and optimal use of Community financial resources should be applied here and now .
We want the European Year against Viol@@ ence to be based on our experience with DA@@ PH@@ NE and to make a definite mark .
What , then , is the outcome of all our work ?
You were right to choose the tor@@ to@@ ise , representing per@@ sever@@ ance , as a symbol during the Convention .
You talk about articles on EU policy and say that some of these are secret .
That is the iron law that I have had to learn , whatever my occasional political reservations .
The way to do that for the European Union should be as follows : instead of sending ar@@ mies to areas of conflict , we should be sending the philosophy and principles of peace , plus a large team of officials to promote dialogue .
Therefore , we should study how that was done and how the philosophy behind it was sent to every area of conflict .
Clearly the United Nations has an important role to play in this process and it is endeav@@ ouring to do so .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome this great opportunity to address you as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council of the European Union , and I am particularly happy that it has come in the context of a debate on human rights .
Yet in the public arena , and particularly in the political arena , all religious interference must be banned , all occ@@ ul@@ tist influence den@@ ounced .
It should concentrate action on a few areas where there is the possibility of getting results and then act with consistency and determination .
The situation in the health sector is no less precarious .
However , while I was thinking over what my decision should be I was on a working trip to El Salvador and Mexico .
My preference is to put the emphasis on an exchange of substance rather than formali@@ sing things between us .
The plan envis@@ ages the integrated approach I spoke about , as we must focus on the opportunities for financing within the framework of existing programmes and ensure that there is more awareness of these opportunities and that they are better utili@@ sed .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists does not agree to that omis@@ sion .
We know that the Commission has compiled a list of settlement products and expor@@ ters , and is trying to expand the list .
Un@@ t@@ ying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness , but we need to acknowledge and recognise , as the Commissioner has made clear , that among certain Member States t@@ ying aid is still common practice .
We need to be pragmatic and re@@ discover the practical value of the notion of governance .
Finally , we in Europe and the International Maritime Organisation must encourage changes to the entire international maritime legislation , creating what I would call a &apos; Galicia Protocol &apos; , similar to the Kyoto Protocol , to resolve the problems of the sea , which is the reserve of humanity .
The same applies to the car@@ goes transported from Mur@@ man@@ sk .
I therefore reject the Commission &apos;s proposal to facilitate the release of oil reserves , even where there is no physical shortage .
These are also the criteria by which we judge the candidate .
We are so@@ rely aware of this .
I am concerned that this inquiry will not be constructive but will be used by the Left in Spain as a stick to beat the government .
These texts must be transposed , harmonised and fully implemented .
In this respect , the budget has the full support of both our committee and all the Members of the House , but only where expenditure related to staff and structures for e@@ ast@@ ward enlargement are concerned .
The Trust Fund must not be confused with the fund administ@@ ering the yields from oil deposits , but must be separate from it .
Those choices are entirely up to the Member State concerned .
If he wants to criticise the French Government , he should not do it here , because it is not the job of this House to judge the French Government .
The sitting is suspended until 9 p.m .
As such , the amendments that aim to restrict the conditions for exceptions receive my support .
The Commission is pursuing this goal in the Council &apos;s working group .
It should recognise and be adap@@ table to the diversity of the different European market structures .
There are governments - Spain , for instance - which object to the system of double majority in the Council and want to rever@@ t to the Nice system , which is complex , not understandable and not a very sensible system .
The social aspects which the text promised to defend will become secondary , and we will slide further down the road ma@@ pped out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Nice .
Why announce now something that is due to happen in 2009 ?
At this crucial time , the European Union is un@@ available to its subscri@@ bers .
The EU can now v@@ indicate its claim to a place on the world stage by bro@@ k@@ ering this strategy .
This is where there is a need for further initiatives , especially together with the United Nations , if we are to make a positive contribution in this area too .
We should , I think , also check whether our amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in Geneva should be gal@@ van@@ ised a bit more .
We must bring the debate with the developing countries on social dumping , child labour and slavery back on the negotiating table .
Clearly , to adopt the list without any strategic assessment of the environmental impact , profitability or practical safety of any of the 18 projects would be merely to rubber stamp it .
On a personal note , I was absent from Parliament for three years , and was able to retri@@ eve a large amount of the data I wanted by computer .
I and my colleagues were therefore stag@@ gered that the Commission largely dis@@ regards the conclusions of that report .
We have not reached that point yet at world level .
I thank Mr Gem@@ elli again for his remarks from which I retain the need for cooperation at all levels .
I would also call for something that is always the subject of some ridi@@ cu@@ le , but which is ec@@ ologically important , namely the pol@@ lin@@ ation premium for colon@@ ies of be@@ es , so that we promote this activity by giving be@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers more support .
In fact , this oral question relates to a very important matter , namely the fact that over many centuries the Member States of the European Union have developed liberal professions , which are expected to fulfil certain specific roles . For example , lawyers are required to administ@@ er justice , and a not@@ ary &apos;s duties include the drawing up of public instruments , while some professions have to o@@ bey very specific professional rules , as is the case with medical practi@@ tioners , pharmac@@ ists and many other liberal professions , where comparable rules and special structures exist .
With regard to the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference , I must say to you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council - and you will understand this given your professional experience - that you have touched our tri@@ ge@@ minus , which is the most sensitive ner@@ ve in the body , as you are well aware .
Well , nothing is being done .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , the European Council will take place at a time when Germany , Italy and Portugal are going through a recession and when France is po@@ ised to follow them .
I urge both Parliament and our colleagues in the Council to make sure that the deadline of achieving the process of simplification is indeed met within the six months specified here .
It is all too logical that mergers are meant to proc@@ ure advantages over against competitors .
Mr Fal@@ la@@ d has done a good job in bringing order to the latter .
The wall will not protect Israeli society from the violence and barbar@@ ism of suicide bom@@ b@@ ings against civilians .
Wher@@ ever terrorism l@@ ur@@ ks , wherever it re@@ ars its head , whatever form it takes , the European Union must not shr@@ ink from fighting it .
- Mr President , horri@@ fying though they may be , the terrorist attacks in the Middle East - whether Palestinian suicide bom@@ b@@ ings against Jews or targeted Israeli strikes against Palestinians - cannot hide the fundament@@ als of the problem .
Why cannot we send our fantastic peace troops to Palestine in order to protect the Palestinian people ?
I should therefore like to thank the House for its cooperation .
It is clear that all countries must actively comply with UN Security Council Resolution 13@@ 73 .
Iranian society as we see it today , therefore , is in fer@@ ment .
- The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 03@@ 19 / 2003 ) by Mrs Her@@ man@@ ge , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the Commission proposal for a Council decision author@@ ising the Member States to ratify , or acc@@ ede to , in the interest of the European Community , the Convention on Jur@@ is@@ diction , Applic@@ able Law , Rec@@ og@@ ni@@ tion , En@@ forcement and Cooperation in respect of Par@@ ental Respon@@ sibility and Meas@@ ures for the Protection of Children ( the 1996 Hague Convention ) ( COM ( 2003 ) 3@@ 48 - C5 @-@ 0@@ 30@@ 2 / 2003 - 2003 / 0@@ 127 ( CNS ) ) .
Ther@@ e@@ after , the permanent concern of Parliament , and obviously of our group , is safety .
- Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have been invited to decide at the second reading on the schedule for opening up freight rail services to competition .
The framework directive establishes the general framework for protecting all types of water ( water in rivers and lakes , together with coastal and ground@@ water ) .
A little sle@@ ep@@ y , I found myself in a car with Mr Na@@ poli@@ tano and Mr Fi@@ ori , who like me were flying from Milan ; I half @-@ closed my eyes and I had a kind of vision .
With regard to foreign aid , we face a new challenge in the 2004 budget in that it is our duty and our desire to make European aid available to the people of Iraq .
It is essential , in this connection , to emphasise the important role played by Eurostat in monetary union .
I can only express the hope that when we vote , certainly where category 1@@ B is concerned , we do not exceed these financial perspectives .
. Mr Rübig , there is currently a set of rules , known as Euro@@ vig@@ nette , which establishes the criteria according to which payment can be established for the use of certain infrastructures , that is to say t@@ olls .
This resolution includes the European Parliament &apos;s concern that it could take recourse to the court against this stand by the Commission on this specific issue , which is a terri@@ bly sensitive issue on which the Commission is acting illegally , while the institutions of the European Union are trying to teach its citizens to act legally .
That will improve the quality of the systems and ratings and is in the interest of all parties involved .
As the time all@@ ot@@ ted to questions to the Commission has el@@ ap@@ sed , Questions Nos 50 to 103 will be replied to in writing ( 6 ) .
The violation of women &apos;s rights in international affairs is an extremely serious issue .
However , in most people &apos;s minds , the success of the accession in the first few years is based on the success of the cohesion policy , on the fact that we will be capable , with the authorities of those countries , of using the money available , which is significant because we are talking about EUR 22 billion for cohesion .
Pro@@ b@@ ably , in the spirit of what is written in the new European Constitution , we will be able to move towards a better sharing of responsibility and therefore towards a greater decentrali@@ sation .
Non @-@ compliance with internal market directives threatens the economic success of the European Union and I very much support Mr Bol@@ k@@ enstein &apos;s action and hope that this leads swiftly to German compliance .
Once again , as I said earlier , that depends on the reactions of the German Government .
There is nothing to be gained from shooting the mess@@ enger , but this most recent ICES report once again highlights the vital importance of listening to the advice of the fishermen as well as to the b@@ off@@ ins .
It only applies to vessels over ten metres in length , even though shorter vessels do play a part in cod fishing .
In any case there will not be one in time for a cod recovery plan to be adopted .
I believe we need a more regional approach .
It might be said that this House is unanimous in its desire for a &quot; firm and final peace agreement &quot; ensuring that Jews , Mo@@ sle@@ ms and Christians can live together .
At the same time , the problems in the south of Ki@@ v@@ u are ongoing .
They merely went to sal@@ vage the ship and limit the disaster .
They are the water carriers .
As far as I am concerned , it is irrelevant whether the money is allocated to Asia or to Latin America , provided that it goes to the poorest people .
In this connection it should be stressed that the problems with the report do not concern these points : what is most essential for the funding of the European Bureau of L@@ esser @-@ U@@ sed Langu@@ ages and concentration camp mem@@ orials is that the legal basis should be brought into force from the beginning of the year .
We should accept and encourage con@@ te@@ station and questions concerning the policies of the European Union .
Commission involvement in Member States &apos; tax arrangements must come with a serious health warning .
The Commission considers that a clear reference to tax barriers , and particularly to double taxation caused by registration taxes , should be stated in these paragraphs , as is the case under the relevant part of the explanatory statement .
However , as it happens , Commissioner , the works council was not consulted in this matter .
I think that if we do not manage to implement this social policy in Europe , a lot of people will turn against Europe .
This initiative , which is intended to promote a more balanced representation of women and men in the composition of the EP following the 2004 elections , is to be welcomed , although it has limitations .
I am not going to speak about Mr Milosevic now , since I have done so on a number of occasions in the past .
For me , as for many others , the most important ethical issue is about reducing human suffering .
Moreover , I would draw your attention to the fact that , even though embry@@ onic stem cells do after all affect first and foremost women , and what women carry within them , there is no question of their becoming research instruments , economically speaking .
Let me say something to Mr Capp@@ ato .
In 1997 , all parties in the Japanese parliament joined in taking the initiative in adopting a ten @-@ year plan , with substantial rates of increase to encourage young scientists .
Thank you , Commissioner .
If Europe wishes to create a genuine Internal Market for the telecommunications sector as well , it is particularly important that we ensure that harmonised legislation is implemented .
Something we see as crucial is the imperative need for greater transparency as regards the European Investment Bank funding criteria and greater involvement of the European Parliament in establishing those criteria .
There must of course be copies of the contracts in all the firms .
I urge you to put immigration in its broad@@ est sense on the agenda for relations with our neighbours .
This should prove more effective than the adoption of unilateral measures .
In a competitive battle of this kind , ports that service a common hinter@@ land will destroy each other .
Every one of us will have to face questions : What is now the real situation as regards balance ?
Instead , the problem is the people smuggling through which un@@ scru@@ pul@@ ous traders enti@@ ce people to try to make their way in by unlawful routes .
Is the Commission aware that prior to the November 2001 notice to impor@@ ters , Member States failed to recover duties after receiving verification answers from Israeli customs confirming that the products in question were produced in settlements and reiter@@ ating Israel &apos;s determin@@ ations that they were entitled to preferential treatment ?
From the perspective of those of us who work in the field of the internal market , it is important to emphasise that this is one of the reasons cited in particular for setting up the Information Security Agency .
Why has this been paraly@@ sed for ten years ?
Experience would suggest that it is not at the level of foreign ministers , still less officials , that the final deal will be cut .
All the elo@@ qu@@ ence of Mr M@@ éndez de Vigo was required to convince us that this proposal represented a fair distribution of powers .
I therefore call on the Commission to implement its programme step by step and perhaps concern itself less with visions than with what it is actually possible to achieve in a man@@ age@@ able and realistic time@@ frame .
He explained that it was because his friends already agreed with him .
The correct one ?
In addition to the substantial progress made on a number of specific issues , it has become clear that some persi@@ sting diver@@ gen@@ ces on specific provisions will be resolved when an agreement on the Union &apos;s future institutional framework is achieved .
I welcome that .
On this basis , both Germany and France took measures to incorporate the substance of the recommendations .
Why are all countries equal , but certain large countries more equal than others ?
It is a dread@@ ful move to give the public the impression that in the Union some states are more equal than others , that the Federal Republic of Germany and France have the right to special treatment because they are Europe &apos;s driving force .
In that way , Parliament and the Council , and I even think the Commission , gain a clear insight into who exactly exam@@ ines these legislative proposals and into the fundamental policy choices that are made during the policy @-@ forming process .
We must ensure that there is real contact and connec@@ tivity and that we get things moving .
That is quite wrong , in our view .
That is why I urge you to extend this provision - if not for ten years , then for six years , not six months - for otherwise , there will be no legal certainty for the companies involved and we will also be unable to determine whether there has been any change in behaviour on the part of the clients and the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople themselves .
I hope that the Commission will see sense and support our very reasonable proposal , and if it does not do so , I trust that the Council of Ministers will vote unanimously to do so .
That is in fact the precise opposite of what we were meant to be achieving by the use of our resources .
That is money that should and could have been used to fulfil the political objectives , and , had it not been used for those purposes , it could have been used in other of the EU &apos;s budget areas , for example research and development .
In conclusion , I have a practical question for Mr Fab@@ ra Vall@@ és .
I must thank my colleagues in the form of the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for having been so flexible and tru@@ sting in the work on this card and for having supported us in finding a solution as early as today , when I also hope we can lay the foundation for reaching an agreement at first reading and so having the proposal implemented in a mere six months .
The way in which health care systems are run is different is every Member State , and the funding too varies from premi@@ ums to paying for it out of tax money .
There was an agreement , and we all agree that we have a success story here .
If it is possible to break a sitting for a formal sitting on the nail , why is it not possible to take the vote at the time which is announced without there being too much difficulty ?
In and for itself , the resolution as a whole contains many good view@@ points and demands .
On the same day , Parliament &apos;s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted Mr Lehne &apos;s report , based on the same compromise text .
A number of amendments concerned informing the employees of the target or offer@@ ee company , and another amendment concerned the importance of consulting the employees of the offer@@ or or pre@@ dat@@ ory company .
The Council did not want to see the withdrawal of Member States &quot; means for interven@@ ing in the case of attempted hostile take@@ over bi@@ ds for their large national companies .
In practice , the committee &apos;s proposal means that the European Parliament must reject the Commission &apos;s proposal in its entirety .
In this connection it is worth mentioning that Parliament succeeded in protecting the funding of Info @-@ Points and rural Car@@ ref@@ ours for next year , when their status is to be clarified .
We have a letter from Commissioner Patten - you can ask Mr Gar@@ rig@@ a Pol@@ le@@ do - saying that progress is on its way and therefore putting money in the reserve has actually been to some real purpose in that field .
The flexibility instrument is already in use , but it is for 2003 @-@ 2004 , and therefore some funds will remain should there be other causes which we have to finance , whether in Iraq or elsewhere .
First st@@ umb@@ ling block , the duration of programmes .
. - I do not think I said anything of the kind .
I know that this is essentially a UK , Irish and perhaps also a Dutch problem .
This guarantees , furthermore , the maximum level of public health protection on the basis of documentation requested regarding quality , effic@@ acy and safety .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
If you want to deta@@ ch the one from the other , then you will end up proposing a solution that lacks both fairness and solidarity .
There is , secondly , another point , namely President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder - two Heads of Government whom I do support in certain political situations , such as over the war in Iraq .
The importance of a common statute means that a solution must be sought together with the Council and without pressure of time .
In this way traffic would not have to pay the present external cost , but one based on a new balanced charge that reflects the volume of traffic .
- Mr President , whilst I naturally sympath@@ ise with the position of Austria and the Austrian MEPs , I consider the free movement of persons and goods one of the European Union &apos;s most important achievements .
The European Parliament has introduced clear rules for cases of so that airlines do not have to act if they are not responsible for the circumstances leading to a cancellation or over@@ booking .
It was thought necessary because some airlines had got into a very bad hab@@ it of can@@ c@@ elling flights at the last minute , over@@ booking flights , inflic@@ ting delay because of in@@ efficient operational practices and then , to add insu@@ lt to injury , they treated their victims - their passengers - with total dis@@ da@@ in and little or no sympathy .
It is not the first time this has happened .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
- Mr President , this issue has been debated in many forums and I thank the rapporteur for his considerable input with regard to this matter , which is essentially connected with the work@@ ings of the internal market and co@@ generation and which will hopefully now be brought to a conclusion .
The Commission will ensure a coordination role and facilitate the exchange of information concerning best practices and concrete experiences with coexistence among Member States , including cross @-@ border aspects .
What happens now is that the EU fleets can do what they like with no supervision whatsoever .
There is a lot of talk about them at the moment , but they are not really known .
I would not like to suggest that this applies to Finland , however .
Mr President , I sympath@@ ise with the Commissioner over the v@@ ag@@ aries of temperature in this building .
With regard to the latter , I grant that the dates set in the original text were over @-@ ambitious .
Nevertheless , the report adopted had been amended to such an extent that nothing remained of the original proposal .
In and for itself , a framework directive could place limits upon legislation governing the internal market .
In fact , this proactive stance ow@@ es nothing to any economic or social imperative - we have not heard anyone l@@ ament the failure of Cancún - but is actually due entirely to your desire to exercise and defend the Commission &apos;s monopoly on representing the EU and negotiating on its behalf in the field of international business and external trade .
Will the Commission support the principle of compensation for British farmers and growers who have purchased dise@@ ased plants and seed from the Netherlands ?
We have done a great deal to enhance our relationship with China . I am keen that we should do the same with India , and I hope that later this year we will be able to produce a strategy document on our relationship with that country .
Therefore , I too believe that this balance should be improved upon , in light of the fundamental objectives of this regulation : health , consumer safety and environmental protection .
More people in Africa - especially children - die from malaria than HIV / AIDS .
We must not forget that the right of each Member State to define , apply and adapt its cultural policies is subject to national legislation and , therefore , this must be done in accordance with their respective national legisl@@ ations .
We greatly look forward to welcoming the new members of the family at an official ceremony in Dublin on 1 May .
That clo@@ sen@@ ess to the electorate is something to which I would ask the Irish Presidency to draw attention at the next European Council .
European Union politicians playing bureaucratic games in Brussels will not help this situation .
We want to develop a common platform for Europe &apos;s engineers , but the one point on which I differ with the rapporteur is that his report seeks to impose a separate regime for engineers , devised from one particular point of view .
At the interface between the two areas lie the efforts to promote high quality training and further training and the protection of mutual cross @-@ border recognition of professional qualifications .
But at least , at European Union level , we should reinforce the action of these collecting societies , so that , at this level , we can have that protection .
That is not always true , and I believe that it should be noted , as the rapporteur notes in her report , that an association is an association , whereas an association with a monopoly , of which one is comp@@ elled to be a member by laws governing rights and duties , is a monopoly .
Apart from that , there is one point on which I differ slightly from Mr Brok .
It was the experience of Nice that prompted us to set up the Convention .
You know that , on the question of national champ@@ ions , we shall seek to follow - or , whenever possible , pre @-@ empt - your invitation to keep up our guard .
That is a priority for this entire Parliament .
We must favour products and manufacturers that , from a social point of view , operate along the lines we advocate .
Parliament wanted the Commission to present a proposal on which Parliament and the Council would then take a decision .
So I started off well , but then I suddenly had to slow up because I thought about the kinds of cases that have been in the papers recently - the Eurostat case obviously springs to mind .
Mr President , it is well known that the textiles and clothing industry still has a considerable presence in the enlarged EU , emplo@@ ying around 2.@@ 7 million people , mainly women , even after sh@@ ed@@ ding some 8@@ 5@@ 0.000 jobs and losing many thousands of businesses between 1990 and 2001 .
These include poverty reduction , weapons of mass destruction , failed states , international crime , terrorism , climate change .
Therefore , Mr President , moving beyond the Parliamentary dimension of relations between the European Union and the United Nations - which is necessary and correct - it is important that we act in an agreed manner , in a complementary manner , and that the European Union demonstrate clearly that its strength lies in its unity and its weakness in its fragmentation .
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dis@@ integration of most of the Communist dictator@@ ships in Central and Eastern Europe , the UN &apos;s prospects of achieving its aims have clearly improved .
The conclusion the Group came to was that we should not pre@@ judge the outcome of this process .
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
For the present there has been no transmission of avian influ@@ enza between humans , but if there is a risk of a world pan@@ demic and if the H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 virus were to combine with a human virus like the fl@@ u virus to create a new , highly con@@ ta@@ gious fatal strain , then I think , Commissioner , that the EUR 1 million credit you have just announced could prove tra@@ gi@@ cally inadequate .
We will now begin the vote , which , as you know , will be interrupted by a formal sitting .
We think it inappropriate to extend the Centre &apos;s competence to include general public health issues .
What rules govern the transfer of money or appropriations from one sub@@ heading to another ?
The Commission has decided to present a proposal which not only respects this own resources ceiling but also allows sufficient scope below this ceiling based on the average over the period .
This means we have very little opportunity for influ@@ encing Turkey , particularly via legal instruments .
EU fish farms undertake rigorous inspection and quality control regimes to ensure that only the highest possible environmental and welfare standards are met and that the public is provided with an entirely safe , non @-@ toxic and reliable product .
I do not believe President Musharraf is doing enough to rein in terrorist groups in Pakistan &apos;s tri@@ bal areas and north @-@ west frontier provinces ; this is o@@ sten@@ sibly because Islam@@ ab@@ ad &apos;s wri@@ t does not run to these parts .
The op@@ ium trade is in full swing , still helping to maintain the war@@ l@@ ords and their ar@@ mies , and that is one of the main problems .
The market may well be an instrument with which this aim can be achieved - I certainly do not rule that out - if its activity is governed by proper guidelines .
Our third is to guarantee consistency with previously established strategic guidelines , especially the financial perspective .
The elimination of financial incentives for early retirement could be one way of achieving this .
I never hear any mention of the need for differenti@@ ation between strategies adopted for areas of economic activity that are fully immer@@ sed in the ma@@ el@@ strom of international competition , for commercial activities that are relatively well protected from international competition and for non @-@ commercial activities .
. - Mr President , the intent of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU @-@ Russia relations is clear - a partnership that is truly worthy of the name .
This implies discussing frankly Russian practices that run counter to European values , such as human rights in Chechnya , media freedom and cooperation on the environment .
This has been evident , for example , in the fact that Russia has been ad@@ am@@ ant about not agreeing to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States of the EU .
I have a question for Mr Patten . Mr Patten , at what point must we speak of a human rights violation ?
The Commission attaches great importance to the renewal of the Daphne programme , which clearly meets a deeply felt need within the voluntary sector and the general public .
So please take a seat , Mrs Wallström .
Europe can simply no longer afford to leave the economic potential of women un@@ utili@@ sed .
In 2000 , the adoption by the United Nations of the Millennium Development Goals gave renewed focus to many of the concerns raised at Cairo and offered the opportunity to reinforce efforts and undertakings .
Unfortunately , the Council does not share this opinion , and it does not appear to have any intention of changing its position .
There is certainly scope for debate about patents and also about common practice in Europe .
When launching its action plan &apos; Simp@@ li@@ fying and improving the regulatory environment &apos; , the Commission therefore also called on the other institutions and the Member States to contribute to the achievement of the common objectives .
This House has developed an alternative model , but we all know that the Council will disregard it .
I wish therefore to observe that we have obtained regulations that may damage small enterprises and that are not limited to combating piracy , which is what is important .
We have voted in favour of Mrs Four@@ t@@ ou &apos;s report ( A5 @-@ 04@@ 68 / 2003 ) on measures and procedures to ensure the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the negotiated compromise package .
Are these men to be tried and if so for what crimes and under what jurisdiction ?
To support the wording of Parliament &apos;s report would be to take a large step backwards in the work to reform European agriculture since Parliament &apos;s wording promotes continued direct aid and production @-@ linked aid to far too great an extent .
I would also like to thank my colleagues for their close cooperation .
I can say the same about agricultural policy .
Docum@@ ents that have been obtained by a civil liberties organisation , EP@@ IC , under the US Freedom of Information Act , reveal that the US @-@ based Nor@@ thwest Airlines - providing connections between main US and European cities - dis@@ closed millions of passenger records to N@@ ASA as part of a massive dat@@ am@@ ining experiment .
It was agreed that this agency would , inter alia , coordinate the operational cooperation between Member States in the management of their external borders , assist Member States in the training of border guards , carry out the type of risk analysis that I have already mentioned , and assist Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical cooperation at borders .
. - When you address the issue of the specific measures that I have mentioned , you are addressing the symp@@ tom and not the cause .
The document states that entry into the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , referred to as Ju@@ de@@ a and Sam@@ aria ( Are@@ as A ) is forbidden without prior written authorisation from the Israeli authorities .
Accordingly , for general aviation involving small aircraft , del@@ ine@@ ated areas have been introduced which are separate from the rest of the airport .
I call upon the international community to take firm action in Haiti in order to stabili@@ se the situation .
Only a few hours after his death , the Ukrainian security services stor@@ med the Kiev station Radio Contin@@ ent and seized all its broadcasting equipment .
The official veter@@ in@@ arian is central to the proposed system of official supervision of meat production .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Schnell@@ hardt , who has negotiated ten@@ aci@@ ously for many years .
Today , however , the problem of regulating the various aspects of transport has become a major component of legislation in the animal production sector .
Therefore , we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in .
She will be a sad loss to this Parliament when she goes back go Finland .
In practice , however , as 20 % of the vehicle fleets of most manufacturers are not fitted with air conditioning , these manufacturers would have met the first step of the quota system without doing anything .
We made a start yesterday and will do everything in our power to keep progress on track throughout the remainder of our presidency .
So , even if the last few are not there , people can see them .
Sig@@ ning the Å@@ rh@@ us Convention requires measures to be adopted that are legally binding on the European Community &apos;s institutions and bodies , and this regulation does this specifically as regards the three pillars of the Convention : access to information , public participation in the decision @-@ making process and access to justice in environmental matters .
The economic situation is improving ; growth prospects are good and , more generally , the economic outlook remains positive .
Croatia has already started to work intensi@@ vely in order to alig@@ n its legislation with European law .
This is the outcome of a decision reached by the Council back in December .
Only the Itali@@ ans have not been compens@@ ated .
. Mr President , it was a short but very interesting debate .
Is there not another option when it comes to ensuring that Turkey develops economically and as a stable democracy , which is in our interests as Europeans , without accession to the European Union being a necessary consequence of that ?
Since an increase in the Community contribution for fisheries control heavy equipment is one way to help to strengthen control capacity at sea , we agree with the rapporteur &apos;s Amendments Nos 8 and 12 , which aim at extending the measure to all Member States and increasing the contribution rate to 50 % .
Does he propose referendums on questions that really matter to the public , such as the re@@ direction of State arms budgets to schools , hospitals and public transport in the EU ?
I think this is an instrument of which we could make much more use .
I myself have taken a very active interest in bringing together those who wish to work with clear goals and dates in the matter of how to achieve a greater proportion of renewable energy .
In that communication , which was addressed to the European Parliament and the Council , the Commission aimed to provide a framework for analysis of the conditions for the application of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union in order to initiate a dialogue with the other two institutions responsible for implementing this important provision .
Regarding amendments re@@ submitted by colleagues , Amendment No 67 , concerning the setting of MR@@ Ls , covers vulnerable groups .
I would also like to sound a warning to the industry here , since it is itself always talking about self @-@ regulation : these requirements will also have to be complied with and corresponding standards created without un@@ due delay .
But for certain issues , sel@@ f@@ - or co @-@ regulation could be the best approach .
Madam President , Commissioner De Palacio , Mr Mom@@ bau@@ r , Mr Sep@@ pä@@ nen , last June the European Union adopted , with difficulty and well behind time in relation to consumers &quot; and European companies &quot; needs , Directive 2003 / 55 / EC which takes decisive steps towards the completion of the liberalisation of the gas market .
The aim is to find the right balance between two elements .
Sur@@ ve@@ ys demonstrate quite clearly a variety of different costs of different printer operating systems , all brought about by operators using these methods which ob@@ lige the consumer to buy printer car@@ tri@@ dges over and over again , instead of re@@ using and ref@@ illing .
Today , or in actual fact , tomorrow after the vote , what I see as a fresh agreement will have been reached and new arrangements will be in place by means of which emission trading will be extended to include third countries .
It is important to recall that in this proposal the Commission has maintained a general restriction on the use of mercury in batteries , in line with the existing Bat@@ tery Directive .
I believe that the strategy on natural resources should include the general problems linked to the issue of how we are to break the link between economic growth and environmental damage .
In 2007 , the Commission will review the two points I have mentioned , as well as the whole of the Integrated Product Policy .
Additionally , given the present ge@@ o @-@ political climate , we must consider how we can prevent the potential threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe .
If goods vehicles are to be subject to higher toll fees the revenues from them must be returned to the transport sector .
It is nevertheless essential to support the guidelines adopted by the Co@@ ci@@ lo@@ vo report in favour of intern@@ alisation of external costs , of cross @-@ financing being extended to all corridors and of its extension to all road networks and not only to trans @-@ European networks , which could give rise to transfers or shifting of traffic .
I should like to combine this amendment with Amendment No 175 , tabled by the Group of the European Socialists with a view to setting an upper limit of EUR 100.000 .
In this debate we are looking ahead to the distant date of 2013 , and although useful policy documents exist we have yet to see them .
The Commission is proposing a different set of budget head@@ ings from those to which we are so accu@@ st@@ omed .
I would like to pay tribute to that .
Commission Verheugen and I would like to set out a little of the thinking behind the Commission &apos;s decision , and I am sure you will agree that it is important for us to say rather more clearly why we have arrived at this extremely welcome conclusion .
. Thank you very much Mr President , thank you very much Commissioner for your detailed explanation .
They have worked closely with the parties and in collaboration with the governments of Greece and Turkey .
We understand the history .
Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate Minister Ro@@ che and Commissioner Patten for the very fine contributions they both made here today , contributions that should be carefully read by Members of this House who would benefit considerably from so doing .
The reality is that in May 2004 the European Union will encomp@@ ass 25 Member States , 20 languages , even more cultures , a great many regions and a truly frag@@ mented market for any business inten@@ ding to develop innovative cross @-@ border digital content products and services .
The debate is closed .
We need to coordinate the budgetary policies of the Member States and the social and environmental convergence rules , particularly concerning working conditions , salary progres@@ sion - yes , salary progres@@ sion - and the environment .
. - This Commission proposal suggesting amendments to the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship , in particular for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , is very important .
. Whilst it is said that employment is one of Europe &apos;s ambitions , the prim@@ acy of monetary policies , and in particular the Stability Pact , prevents us , regre@@ ttably , from priori@@ ti@@ sing jobs .
It is expected that a Union that is generous to everyone will be looked on favou@@ ra@@ bly by public opinion , the broad@@ est section of society and local authorities .
Frau@@ d , em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement and ne@@ po@@ tism will only be prevented in the future if public opinion is properly informed and able to form a view .
To this end , we must conclude the agreement on the Constitutional Treaty as soon as possible , which would genuinely provide us with the instruments and capacities Europe needs in order to become a reality not only on our continent , but as a principal player on the international stage .
The more we remove borders , the more we must increase the new rights of the citizens .
On all of these points , most Members of my group are not expecting mira@@ cles from the European Council , which - by complete chance , of course - comes a few days after the European elections .
Mr President , many people had high hopes for your Presidency , the Irish Presidency .
Thirdly : Europe must be a union of unions , a system whereby the unions strengthen and build on each other .
I believe that the future of Europe , Mr President , will involve overcoming five challenges : completing enlargement , creating more efficient and democratic European institutions , effectively combating terrorism inside and outside Europe , providing the Union with the financial resources it needs to implement financial policies and , finally , to turn the Union into a factor for peace and development at global level .
Mr President , hum@@ b@@ led and honoured at the privilege granted to me as the first MEP from Malta to address this Assembly so soon after enlargement , I believe that the European Constitution should emphasise a union of citizens just as much as a union of sovereign states - a Union based on the value of &apos; person@@ alism &apos; and not of individu@@ alism .
Mr Sol@@ bes might well have gone , but the lack of political responsibility within the Commission remains .
I regret that the accession celebrations in Ireland on 1 May could not have included a celebration of a united Cyprus in the European Union , in fact I do so on a particularly personal note , because the celebrations for Cyprus were held in my own home town and it would have been marvellous if we could have welcomed all of the people of Cyprus there on that occasion .
The statements and actions by the Council since the refer@@ enda clearly confirm that the European Union remains strongly committed to providing tangible assurance to the Turkish Cypriot community that its future will be in a united Cyprus within the European Union .
Mr La@@ gen@@ di@@ jk asked whether , in the light of the lessons we learned last year regarding Iraq , we should have a common foreign and security policy .
This latter point is important and we must keep to it , but it is not more important , it is never more important than the objective of full employment , which was an essential element in the old European model and , unfortunately Commissioner , I did not , despite listening to you carefully , hear you mention full employment in your review of the European model .
A so @-@ called baby @-@ boom generation is starting productive adult life in Poland .
- Mr President , whilst I would like to congratulate the enlarged Commission , I want again to ask the same fundamental question others here have already referred to .
We had never before had an election campaign in the history of Parliament , says he who is now celebrating 25 years of being an MEP .
At some point we have all been new Members of the Union and , from Vil@@ nius to Lisbon , or from Edinburgh to Athens , we are all of the same Europe .
But now , we have already begun the vote and it is too late to deal with your request .
The Convention outcome in particular - the great bulk of which was un@@ altered in the Intergovernmental Conference - reflected much that was brought to the table by the representatives of this Parliament .
As you say , this Parliament can also claim a share in the success story .
It is an aff@@ ront to and an assault upon both .
One voice says : we see mi@@ strust in the citizen , there is euro@@ scep@@ ticism .
Thank you for your attention .
It is not simply by telling us that you will interpret this Stability Pact with the future in mind that we can develop towards a real growth pact .
the imposition on the peoples of the Ε@@ U of the mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ingly named European Constitution , which will also safeguard the militar@@ istic , auto@@ cratic and anti @-@ labour character of the Ε@@ U institution@@ ally .
A further problem facing us is the role of forests in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very grateful to the Commissioner for pointing out that every instrument is needed in order to guarantee climate protection , and for describing the IC@@ AO goals as contrary to all the goals that we in the EU have set .
We have to concentrate on implementing environmental legislation to the full , thus avoiding problems of this kind .
At the time you elected me , I said I would wait until this plenary sitting to outline my strategic vision of the first half of this legislat@@ ure to you .
It is important for Parliament to bear in mind that it is an institution in receipt of public funds facing new challenges of size and efficiency .
What do we know about the opposition , which some of our colleagues , in all respect , are endeav@@ ouring to bring to power ?
Nevertheless , the situation requires our constant attention , as it is becoming worse and worse .
Let us not conf@@ use our values nor our objectives and priorities .
This is a result of the time lag which exists in the field of agriculture , whereby expenditure takes place one year later .
The n + 2 rule , of which you are also aware , means that we must make sure that the Budget contains sufficient funds to cover requests for payment as they are made .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Nicol@@ a@@ ï , you have noticed that as far as your restrictive draft budget is concerned , you are dealing with a European Parliament which has a great deal of self @-@ confidence .
Mr President , it is with considerable pleasure that I can inform you and Parliament that the Commission has today adopted a proposal that modi@@ fies national regimes of design protection so as to liber@@ alise the secondary market in spare parts for repair purposes .
We have no legal basis in this field .
We shall therefore approach the end of the year deadline in full knowledge of the facts , but also with a tool@@ box that has recently undergone significant improvements .
The AU mission is currently staff@@ ed by 125 monitors , including monitors from the EU and the United States , and has completed approximately 20 investigations into ce@@ ase@@ fire violations .
I hope they are forthcoming and that the government of the Russian Federation will not conclude that the only answer to terrorism is to increase the power of the Kremlin .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , &quot; It was our principles that lead us to confront terrorism with determination and without concessions , because it represents the greatest denial of individual freedoms , since it is an attack on the very foundations of democratic co @-@ existence , because we must defend ourselves against those whose fundamental aim is our destruction . &quot; I have borro@@ wed these words from a victim of terrorism who spoke them last week in Berlin before a sensitive and committed audience .
What I can say , firmly , is that I am convinced that our decision to take the multilateral , trust fund route was absolutely the right one .
At the same time , though , we have to do this through dialogue , so that terrorism does not prove to be a Hy@@ dra , with several new heads growing every time we cut one off , and we must not create breeding grounds for it .
We see it as a good thing that the deficit threshold should , in principle , remain at 3 % .
And the Stability Pact , which is now ten years old , was conceived on the basis of a degree of mi@@ strust towards certain countries which appeared incapable of passing the ex@@ am .
I am very grateful that you have given me the opportunity to say a few words now .
. Mr President , I should like to answer the second supplementary question .
Under Directive 64 / 2@@ 21 / EEC , decisions refusing entry or ordering exp@@ ulsion from the territory must be notified to the person concerned , informing him or her of the grounds of public policy , public security or public health upon which the decision has been taken .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank God for giving me the chance to speak before Parliament on the most important issue of modern times , namely the defence of life .
I see the f@@ ingers of the Vati@@ can all over this .
We know that , beside the destruction of their habit@@ ats , international trade is the greatest threat to the survival of many end@@ angered species .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is in@@ conceivable that we are discussing the Mal@@ di@@ ves when this name ev@@ okes for us all holidays and a scene of paradise .
Two years ago , in response to international protests , he promised democratic reforms , but , as the Commission &apos;s report testi@@ fies , the announcement was not followed up by actions .
Liberals and Democrats believe that we have not gone far enough on the road to economic reform or achieved what we could have .
You have lack@@ ed ambition in implementing the Lisbon strategy , in improving economic governance and in promoting policies in favour of young people .
The problem was that it had for too long been too indul@@ gent towards the institution to which it was closest , namely your own .
Madam President , I agree with Mr Solana that the step @-@ by @-@ step policy is no longer valid .
Secondly , following this diagnosis , we must understand that a political project is more than an action plan ; it is not simply a series of measures , it requires effort by the governments , the Council and the Commission in order to deal with the problem .
Nor , certainly , can we be reas@@ su@@ red by the recent declarations made by the Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate , Mr But@@ ti@@ gli@@ one , nor , for that matter , by those I have heard made this evening by Mrs Kl@@ amt .
It is a threat we have to face in addition to the threat from the nationalist terrorism of ETA , which is weaker than ever , it is true , but which still has the capacity to kill .
That concludes the debate on the report .
An incentive of this kind , which is hu@@ gely concentrated , could really help the African continent to take a step forward .
It is perfectly clear , Mrs Reding , that you have done an excellent job of finally establishing a genuine fight against drug use , at European level and at world level .
I voted in favour .
The next item is the debate on the report ( A6 @-@ 00@@ 14 / 2004 ) by Mr Li@@ pi@@ etz , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the 2003 Annual Report of the European Central Bank ( 2004 / 2@@ 144 ( INI ) ) .
That is a point that must be addressed head @-@ on , for much of what you have said we Social Democrats can agree with .
There is just one more thing I would like to say , and that is that what the out@@ going Commission , as regards jobs in the motor industry , has covered itself with is not just glory .
Member States should prepare for long periods of high prices by introducing interim fiscal solutions , stock@@ p@@ iling supplies , which we need , exploiting new sources of energy , and reduced and more efficient consumption .
We have no time to lose ; the time has come to take action and to work together for the benefit of the citizens .
I have to say that I found nothing in your speech this morning to increase my confidence .
This House faces a heavy choice .
Today you ask us to trust you ; my reply to you is that you , rather , should trust Parliament and its judgments .
I hope that the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in matters relating to the Budget will continue to be as good as it has been over the last five years .
Only if we communicate what we are trying to do to people where they actually are , and only if we are really pro @-@ active in promoting the Constitution over the coming months , will we be able to win the people of Europe over to the European project , which makes political sense .
What is the use of creating new agencies every year if the necessary funding is not available ?
The vote will take place on Thursday .
The focus for the Lisbon Agenda should not be international bench@@ marking .
In July when Prime Minister Bal@@ ken@@ ende addressed Parliament , he said that Europe &apos;s economy has &apos; sti@@ ff jo@@ ints and makes little use of its head &apos; .
Some - Mrs Fra@@ sson@@ i and Mr Catania - asked more specifically about the ideas on asylum and migration policy .
The adverse effects are already visible .
Mr Schulz has the floor .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Presidency considers it essential to suspend the sitting and ask the political groups to meet , but before resu@@ ming the plenary sitting and following the meetings of the political groups , I shall call the Conference of Presidents .
Indian involvement is also needed when it comes to the situation in Afghanistan , Nepal , Sri Lanka and Burma , issues that we will also discuss at the summit .
That was a positive gesture towards Serbia and Montenegro .
Yes , Mr President , returning to the irrit@@ ating issue of our exceeding the margin for Category 3 , it seems that we have finally identified that we have exceeded the margin for Category 3 by a sum of EUR 5@@ 8@@ 0.000 .
( 3 ) Sav@@ ings should be made in a number of areas .
For that reason , 18 months ago , on 10 February 2003 , the European Parliament called for a moratorium on the manufacture and use of such cluster m@@ uni@@ tions and cluster bombs , and for them to be banned ou@@ tri@@ ght in the long term .
Ladies and gentlemen , your EU has not been a success .
In reaction to this , various attacks have ensu@@ ed on mos@@ ques and Islamic schools in the Netherlands .
Lic@@ ence applications for these activities will become subject to the criteria and practices set out in the Code of Conduc@@ t .
One of its tasks will be to assess the results of the Convention over the last ten years and future trends .
The presidency &apos;s ideas in the environmental field sound good but should be translated into results .
The EU can commit to this too .
However , we have seen the rate of recycling of packaging waste increase steadily from 9@@ 3.000 tonnes in 1998 to just over 4@@ 14@@ .000 tonnes in 2003 .
It was no doubt to him that a distinguished colleague was referring when on Monday he talked about the visitors to the island , and I am sure it was with particular bit@@ tern@@ ess that his party colleague spoke of him .
It means that this is not the time to change our European policy , but rather for F@@ ide@@ l Castro and the Cuban regime to change thei@@ rs .
I believe we would all agree that their aspi@@ ration is to overcome the immense deficiencies they suffer in both the economic field and in the field of freedoms and civil , social and political rights .
Is Mr Barroso in charge of inter @-@ group discipline ?
I have confidence in Mr Barroso as a good conductor for an orchestra that has yet to tune up .
Whether his abilities , which were not up to cop@@ ing with energy issues , will be adequate for the tax portfolio remains to be seen .
The situation in Côte d &apos;@@ Ivoire is primarily about the blame game .
I repeat that he is supported by the United States and the fact that he is surprised that some countries are hesit@@ ating is the ep@@ it@@ ome of arrogan@@ ce .
Like most of you , I have been witnessing for some time now a seman@@ tic debate between accession and privileged partnership .
We in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy also have an interest in highlighting and applau@@ ding the progress Turkey has made in the economic field in terms of the criteria established by the Union and , in particular , we wish to emphasise its compliance with the Community in fields such as energy policy , industrial policy , research and development and telecommunications .
It is in the interests of the Union to integrate Turkey firmly into European structures , and it is evi@@ dently in the interests of Turkey to b@@ ind itself into those structures .
It is a step towards a European learning area , as my predecessor said during the first reading .
More exchanges of young tra@@ ine@@ es must be encouraged at every level , with primary importance atta@@ ching to financial support .
It is clear that we must demonstrate flexibility and show ourselves to be capable of adapting to change .
If you do that , you will be on the right track .
Mr Poettering seemed to be of the same mind , and I endorse the views he expressed .
She would do much better to stick to her own proposal , which is much more remin@@ is@@ cent of Grund@@ t@@ vi@@ g &apos;s message of &quot; freedom for Lok@@ i as well as for Th@@ or . &quot;
This is an important issue , ladies and gentlemen .
.- I voted for the request for consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee - European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( E@@ AF@@ R@@ D ) .
The case before us concerns the judicial process relating to behaviour that bears no relation to political activity .
All in all , it has therefore been successfully ensured that the other institutions - that is to say , apart from Parliament and the Council , the Court of Justice , the Court of Auditors , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Super@@ visor - are able to make the planned staff appointments resulting from enlargement , staff@@ ing reforms and the reform of financial administration .
It is precisely in that area that our citizens have seen European leadership fail too often .
It is very important that we should agree on the future financial framework next year .
It is not acceptable , as the Commission proposes , to allow the commitments to pro@@ lifer@@ ate to 1.@@ 27 % of gross national income .
As you know , it is a very important conference and he has asked me to stand in for him .
We agree that we do not view the outs@@ ourcing of internal EU responsibilities to camps in countries such as Libya as offering any sustainable solution , or even a short @-@ term solution , to those seeking asylum .
The Commission will ensure that the deadline is met and that the European Parliament will play a key role in that task .
European citizens have pointed out on inn@@ um@@ erable occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective enforcement has been an appreci@@ able weakness of the current system .
This is resulting in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travelling to Italy by routes other than Austria all of a sudden .
It is actually gro@@ tes@@ que that export subsidies are paid when horses , co@@ ws and sheep have to be sent out of the EU .
I welcome that , and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible , and in particular to introduce a maximum eight @-@ hour journey time for both slaughter and further f@@ atten@@ ing animals .
Therefore we will continue to monitor the situation and get this evidence that can be used in a future proposal .
I turn briefly to the amendments proposed in the report before us .
In an area such as this , with such considerable implications for fundamental rights , it is unten@@ able that the executive should make law in this way .
My group supports the wishes of the black majority of the population for the return of most of the land to them .
That is something in which we should take great satisfaction .
My decision also has to do with the fact that the Left , during the course of the Convention , largely refra@@ ined from contributing any practical proposals of its own to the process , and with its failure to come up with any real alternatives to what it now rejects .
It is true to say that the Zap@@ ater@@ o Government , after winning the elections of 14 March , un@@ blocked the process of approving the Constitution , but I would like to say - and I cannot see any Member of the Spanish Pe@@ oples &quot; Party , and I would therefore ask the Vice @-@ President of their Group , Mrs Gross@@ et@@ ête , to communicate this on my behalf - that the Convention began with the Spanish Presidency of the Council of Mr Aznar , and it was he who called for the referendum .
It is difficult to say where a line can be drawn between the Community method and the inter @-@ state method in foreign policy , and Mr Rehn , the new Commissioner , admitted as much during his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
Indeed , we must depl@@ ore the fact that European governments have not followed all the proposals made by the Convention , the consequence of which is that we shall gradually have to adapt the Constitution as we go along .
I am also very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for its efficient handling of the budgetary question , which has enabled us to vote today .
The difficulties revealed by the opinions of the other committees will resur@@ face sooner or later .
The famous social mainstreaming clause setting out the Union &apos;s obligation to ensure that its every policy promotes the objectives of high employment , environmental protection , public health , education and equality between men and women can only be applied under good laws .
A strong democratic European Union moving forward - this is essential , not just in the interest of our country .
Without their support , the Constitution makes no sense .
I have only just received the Green Paper , and so I have not had the chance to read the whole document , only the first few pages .
The Commission has highlighted that these same establishments have been approved for in@@ tra @-@ EU trade following the enlargement process .
I wish to note , however , that the country of origin approach does not apply for services provided through a fixed commercial presence in the host country .
I thank you once again , Commissioner .
This means better implementation of the objectives agreed in common , which , in turn , means more responsibility and more em@@ power@@ ment at national level to deliver the common objectives .
I much appreciate the presidency &apos;s statement that economic growth is important but that the other two pillars of stability are also needed , namely social and environmental development .
Mr M@@ ote , you said that you would like to leave the European Union because it represents everything to which you are opposed and which you reject .
In answer to this , I proposed , as part of the pledge , that another EUR 100 million be allocated from the emergency reserve to provide humanitarian assistance .
. I abstained from voting on this report for several reasons .
In the Netherlands in the next couple of months , I shall be involved in the campaign of my party , the Socialist Party , to persuade a majority of voters to reject this fla@@ wed text .
As I told the previous speakers , you will get your answer in due course .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the citizens of the EU Member States do not expect us to talk in sound@@ bit@@ es , but to be honest .
En@@ or@@ mous damage was done to wide stretches of beach , re@@ efs were destroyed , their cor@@ al filled with sand and di@@ rt , and machinery wash@@ ed out to sea constitutes a ti@@ cking time @-@ bomb .
This is made clear by two figures ; firstly , a great many of the poorest countries are forced to spend over 40 % of their GN@@ P on debt servi@@ cing .
The Council suggested that such cooperation cover all aspects of illegal immigration , such as return and read@@ mission , the fight against trafficking in human beings and the networks associated with such trafficking , all forms of illegal immigration , management of borders and the strengthening of capacities in the sphere of immigration control .
I repeat that this is one of the key topics of the next informal meeting of the ministers responsible for immigration , which will take place at the end of this month in Luxembourg .
Ukraine will never be the same again .
The Commission informed the teachers &apos; representatives , together with the teachers concerned , at the general assembly held on 18 June 2004 , before the decision was notified .
Regarding HIV and Aids , prevention is also a priority .
That was the one and only reason for my amendment .
Vice @-@ President Wallström will be present tomorrow at the Conference of Committee Chair@@ men , and this within the framework of what the Commission wishes to be a permanent and regular dialogue concerning the issues that have priority for us , from the points of view both of programming and of establishing political priorities .
This forms part of a fast @-@ track approach that is vital for the Union .
The proposal that is now being debated is far too long in coming .
I should also like to commend Mr Di Pietro for his work and for the proposals that he is putting forward on the reduction of time @-@ limits and the conditions for access to personal data .
This criterion is so complicated that it would introduce to this document - which is a simplifying document - new complic@@ ations for local communities .
Thank you Mr President .
Since the debate in September , Parliament appears to have adopted a passive stance , whereas it should instead be exercising a key role in the reform process , above all allowing all Members and groups to give a clear outline of the possible strategies .
EU citizens expect the real economic growth they have repeatedly been promised in recent years , for example at EU summits .
. Mr President , I would like to thank all the honourable Members who have spoken for their contributions to the debate , which I have found very interesting .
I say this in advance , so that you can tell them what Parliament has done to make many of those statistical reports unnecessary .
It only means that people have to go to the authorities , have a new photograph taken and be issued with a new licence document , even though , as the rapporteur rightly recognises , the authorisation resulting from the original driving test remains valid .
In conclusion , I should like to reiterate that the Commission is grateful for the information provided by the honourable Member and it will examine any relevant information provided by European industry .
The Court of Justice found against those countries in October @-@ November 2004 .
It can lead to tangible results helping the citizens regain hope for their future whilst respecting them as what they are .
I voted in favour .
The inter@@ mo@@ da@@ lity proposed in Europe &apos;s transport policy and the high levels of environmental protection and quality that we want can only be achieved by revitali@@ sing areas of activity that can transform these ambitions into reality .
We are not and must not feel alone .
It is true that , since it joined the WTO , China has seen a constant increase in its share in the international textile and clothing trade .
We have helped our citizens , Mr President .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
And if , in any case , these cuts are effec@@ ted , will you still be in favour of calling for the funds to be doubled ?
I believe that similar cross @-@ border collabor@@ ative projects deserve to be followed and encouraged , as they primarily reinforce the regional dimension as part of the Lisbon process .
The swift commitment of support to projects like that offered by the Maritime Res@@ cu@@ e Institute in St@@ on@@ eh@@ av@@ en , Scotland , is just one example , and it is much more directly in tune with Parliament &apos;s earlier call .
There is a real risk that the vessels sent to the Asian countries will be suited neither to those countries &quot; fishing habits nor to their environment .
We must not allow the businesses concerned to side@@ step the agreed conditions on the basis of which they enjoy those subsidies , obligations such as long @-@ term production in the territory and maintaining jobs .
. I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on action against hunger and poverty because I feel that we must keep a close eye on all of the measures that have been proposed and put in place to combat this scour@@ ge that affects millions of people around the world .
It calls for flexibility , for structural reforms to take account of ageing , which will call retirement schemes and labour law into question .
We cannot approve all of them .
This is where it is cause for concern that Europe &apos;s major electricity providers are now also the main suppliers of gas .
The latest oil price increases are a strong reminder that the oil market remains volatile .
Since this Regulation came into force in the 1970s , it has been fundamentally revised . Moreover , improvements have been made along the way .
For this reason , during this term in office , we have introduced into each parliamentary committee a Member responsible for monitoring gender issues , which cannot be dealt with in an isolated fashion , in a kind of concep@@ tual gh@@ etto , but which must affect all policies horizont@@ ally .
I am convinced that the European Parliament and the Commission will continue to work towards these same objectives and that by also involving civil society and the NGOs as far as possible , we will be able to take other measures to promote equality .
I can very much identify , and indeed agree , with the different elements he listed .
Finally , we should not forget the Israeli @-@ Syrian dimension of this conflict .
Only respect for law in international relations and for democracy in internal affairs can guarantee peace , stability and prosperity across the Middle East as a whole .
A moment ago , you mentioned only social services .
The US market in particular offers good opportunities for their high @-@ grade and innovative p@@ liers .
Our group is very definitely behind them in this , and we are also glad to see the Commission represented here not only by such important members , but also in such numbers .
The second message confirms the role of SMEs as job cre@@ ators and innov@@ ators in a proactive and balanced industrial policy , one focused on the leading corporations , but also - and perhaps primarily - on those small companies which , again , are the key to job creation in Europe .
Moreover , I fail to understand how anyone can support the euro without supporting the Stability Pact .
We have demonstrated today that it is genuinely possible to reach a stronger and dynamic consensus .
The Council has round@@ ly condemned the attack which took the life of Ra@@ fik Har@@ ir@@ i , former President of the Leban@@ ese Council of Ministers .
It would be un@@ reasonable to make people pay for this surveillance of themselves .
I can tell you that by the end of this year the Commission will publish a guidance manual designed to explain the funding procedures for Natura 2000 , while in 2006 workshops will be organised in every Member State to explain the funding opportunities .
With regard to the external element of the proposal , the &quot; Everything but Ar@@ ms &quot; ( EB@@ A ) initiative should include quantitative instruments for controlling imports similar to those that already exist for ACP countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their report .
Although , as many Members have indicated , changes are needed , it generally tends in the right direction .
That in itself is sufficient reason to vote against the draft resolution .
The vote will take place next .
Moreover , the Council has created the European B@@ order Management Agency . This agency will be operational as from 1 May 2005 .
The Commission is of course looking forward with great interest to the results on the unresolved issues that the Green Paper on immigration has brought to the notice of everybody here , without prescri@@ bing solutions , as you know , but stating the issues .
Let us therefore be realistic about the options that data retention opens to us .
They inevitably face numerous problems and cannot but come up against many obstacles : the legal system is different from what it is at home .
If it is accepted , in principle , that over @-@ ti@@ red@@ ness k@@ ills and inj@@ ures , then responsible rules are needed .
I believe that , in this field , we need to act intel@@ lig@@ ently and pragmati@@ cally .
I would add , and I would like to stress this point somewhat , that , if we agree to a delay in the introduction of digital ta@@ cho@@ graph@@ s , we leave ourselves open to legal action from those in the relevant professions who are ready .
The reali@@ gnment of the strategy towards growth and employment within a context of sustainable development won broad support .
That was a message from this spring summit which should not be under@@ estimated .
Can the Council confirm the modification resulting from the amendment announced by Mr Le@@ wand@@ owski ?
I reaffir@@ m my belief that Bulgaria and Romania should become members of the EU .
These are two of the tasks that our troops have to cope with there , and they are equally important and difficult .
For obvious reasons , however , it is necessary to define where adjustments are required . We are working towards this .
With regard to H@@ iz@@ bollah , to respond to Mr Martin &apos;s speech , I think that it is a complicated group .
That said , competition policy is an exclusive competence of the EU and the Commission has a very important mission in that regard .
Instead of coming up with vague ideas for the harmonisation of different aspects of economic and tax law , the European Commission should focus on completing the basic task that has been outstanding for some 50 years , namely bringing about the common market .
As representatives of our constituents , we are duty bound to defend their rights in the EU .
The main next steps in the provisional timetable for the negotiations in Un@@ esco are as follows . The Spring Executive Board will be held on 18 @-@ 28 April 2005 .
Gen@@ u@@ ine reform of fisheries policy is required , together with a totally different view of our relationship with poor countries and of what constitutes a sustainable use of our natural resources .
The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides an appropriate legal basis to draw up and implement Community action in the field of sport .
Nobody would dare to treat the bar@@ ra@@ cks of Au@@ schwi@@ tz in this way ; therefore , here we have un@@ equal opportunities as well , even if we talk differently .
I do not think it belongs in the Services Directive , a view also expressed by a number of other people in this House .
. Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with a few exceptions , the measures contained in the financial services plan have already been implemented , or are well on the way to being so .
She has produced a balanced text that takes a look at the European internal financial market - to which , over recent years , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has devoted a great deal of attention - and , while doing a good job of analysing our present situation , also looks towards the future .
For the time being , I consider the Lamfalussy structures to be sufficient , but they need to be closely and continuously monitored and adapted , or further developed if needed .
The Commission will play an active role with regard to third countries that enforce visa requirements .
- Mr President , Mr Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , we are in favour of reciprocity as a fundamental principle of visa policy and we feel that a common European policy on visas should always be founded on the principle of solidarity .
While able to agree with much of this report , I felt comp@@ elled to abstain because of the amendments emb@@ racing abortion on demand and the blan@@ ket attack on capital punishment , which I regard as legitimate where there is a transpar@@ ently fair legal system based on due process of law .
Among many examples , the report :
Their identities and photographs have been published , in contra@@ vention of Polish law , to try to put pressure on the judges .
Mr President , religious freedom is one of Europe &apos;s important fundamental values .
As we have heard , we have the mo@@ ti@@ vel@@ ess murder of an innocent man .
As this would only take us to 2013 , which is before the date on which the common position proposes that the quality standards would come into effect , the Commission does not regard this amendment as realistic .
I should now like to point out the links between this report and the discussions taking place on European programmes in the field of education and Media 2007 .
In my view , the solution presented in the C@@ erc@@ as report is an excellent one , treating periods of on @-@ call duty as working time , in accordance with the Court judgments , while proposing that we allow the stand @-@ by and rest times to be calculated differently by collective agreement .
.
I welcome the measures on informing the public and emergency plans for areas regularly affected by flooding , and we therefore supported these proposals .
I am also opposed to the removal of the &quot; sufficient &quot; classification , which gives Member States greater room for manoeuvre in terms of managing the suit@@ ability of bathing water .
It is of course necessary and desirable to protect the environment with ever @-@ ti@@ ghter regulations .
The magazine asked whether political decision @-@ makers thought they lived in an alternative universe where the laws of nature did not apply , and went on to say that no one would ever view a risk of economic collapse so non@@ chal@@ antly .
This point is linked to the one on the European area of justice .
There is in fact a consensus for keeping the common market organisation in its present form .
The UN &apos;s commission of inquiry into the war crimes in this province has unequi@@ vo@@ cally described them as no less serious in their cru@@ el@@ ty than genocide .
We must , however , be aware of the fact that an unsatisfactory situation can and must be changed , moreover because this seems to me to be a sector in which political will can assist us .
A number of factors are creating an atmosphere of uncertainty around the countries in that region .
Presiden@@ tial elections are scheduled for July : I have confirmed this from the Internet .
They were not liber@@ ated .
I desc@@ ended into the corridors and hall@@ ways below ground in which the f@@ ates of the millions of victims are depic@@ ted .
To provide the security , prosperity and opportunity which our fellow citizens expect government to deliver , we have to work together .
It is of no help to anyone for the Turkish Cypri@@ ots to be so far behind the Greek Cypri@@ ots in income and economic development .
. - Thank you , Minister , for your reply to Mr Pap@@ adi@@ mou@@ lis &apos;s question .
Mr President , I wish to make a statement in accordance with Rule 145 .
This is being undertaken .
As I see it , Romania is one example of how it is not that simple to get your hands on reliable data .
What do you propose to do about it ?
It is com@@ plac@@ ent and patron@@ ising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high @-@ tech while China simply does the manufacturing .
- Mr@@ President , Commissioner Wallström , only a matter of metres from here stands the Ar@@ te Studio , one of the most modern studios in Europe .
Thank you for your attention !
At the same time , on the basis of the agreed policy of the European Union , communication channels with the Burmese regime will continue to be kept open .
It will be included on the agenda for the next par@@ ts@@ ession .
Let me reiterate to all of you , President and Members of the European Parliament , that my entire college and I are committed to the highest standards of transparency and ethical conduct .
I would prefer it if Members were more active in also dealing with this issue .
At the same time we know that just outside the Union &apos;s borders there are literally slave markets , where young women and girls are sold to be traffi@@ cked into the sex industry in different parts of our Union .
I therefore call on my fellow Members to sign an appeal for her release .
I thank the political groups which worked with me to achieve this agreed motion for a resolution and to speed up the procedures which will extend the life and the implementation of these Community programmes .
Our view was based on our knowledge that rapid technological development was taking place whereby we may perhaps , in the future , dev@@ ise new forms of bul@@ l bar and fron@@ tal protection systems , as well as new tests .
Madam President , for the Italian and the English boo@@ ths : the match is now 33 , with about ten minutes to go . I knew that the chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market would be happy about that , not probably as a Liver@@ pu@@ d@@ lian but otherwise .
Innovation is key to a company &apos;s success and thus sec@@ ures jobs .
We should also take political decisions with a view to ensuring that our various goals are mutually reinforcing .
My Group does not believe that economic growth automatically produces significant employment , nor does it automatically produce sustainable development .
It is true that we are going to discuss the national programmes when they are drawn up , but I hope that the Commission is not content simply to be a letter box nor that it restrict itself to poli@@ tely pra@@ ising the national programmes , but that it will demand that the States demonstrate courage , determination and au@@ d@@ acity , which is what is needed in order to put an end to the enormous pessimis@@ m that I have intended to describe here .
Any requests for temporary derogations must be kept to an absolute minimum and should be scrut@@ in@@ ised thoroughly by the Commission . Implementation of this Directive should also be linked with full compliance with Directive 2003 / 23 / EC which provides for the compulsory wearing of se@@ at@@ belts on co@@ aches , where fitted , from May 2006 .
The resolution provides guidelines for the Member States &quot; employment policies .
Finally , with a view to respecting the division of competence within the Member States , we also suggested a few changes , because we de@@ em it important that the governments that col@@ late this spatial information - those are , in many cases , the regional and local governments - are also involved in the coordination of the infrastructure and are also responsible for the contacts with the European Commission .
It is , in fact , the same regulatory framework already used for the completion of the single market in insurance and other financial services .
Some@@ one mentioned the need for Members to be allowed to priori@@ tise rural development funds on the third axis .
Nevertheless they do relate to problems that often genuinely exist and need to be addressed and that represent a breeding ground for people driven to des@@ pair and therefore sus@@ cep@@ tible to terrorist lun@@ acy .
That solidarity clause , though not yet implemented , worked rather well in the face of the Madrid attacks .
We need to be visi@@ bly proactive here , enabling town @-@ tw@@ inning schemes to flour@@ ish , enabling artists to meet each other and enabling people to have a real experience of Europe &apos;s cultural rich@@ es .
As we heard very clearly from our rapporteur , we need one that will be in our interests and the interests of our electorate and that is what we hope will come out of the Council in a few days &quot; time .
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I would be happy if we were in a position today to speak about development , cooperation , solidarity , tolerance and a rational and fair distribution of wealth generated .
This is entirely hypo@@ critical .
However , we should not forget the problems related to that matter .
We carry on down the same path , albeit perhaps not at such speed .
They have not yet understood that , if we want Europe to be capable of taking action for employment , for social protection , then we need to give it the means to do so .
I know that you intend to treat the peoples of Europe with cont@@ empt by pushing this through without ratification .
There must be a European debate in tune with the debates at national level because that is the only means of emerging greater and stronger from this challenge .
These are the technical corrections required to ensure that the text and table are consistent .
The Union would like a certain number of matters of vital importance for the achievement of the Millennium goals to be taken into due account in the conclusions of the summit .
The brut@@ ality with which the Uz@@ be@@ k Government has responded is setting the earth sm@@ oul@@ dering in Uz@@ bekistan .
That is not in our , or anyone &apos;s , interest .
The focus of our efforts at this point remains the conclusion of an agreement on how the funds are allocated , not only between the Commission and the Member States , but also among the Member States themselves .
The Council therefore reaffir@@ ms the aims of the Stability Pact and its bench@@ marks , and prevents any expenditure from being excluded from the deficit calculation .
This is a major weakness , especially with respect to fishing .
As rapporteur of this proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dol@@ ph@@ in Con@@ servation Programme , I was delighted to see that it is possible to coordinate strategies that can meet the interests of fishermen and of all of those involved , while ensuring that eco @-@ systems can be preserved .
Unfortunately , the situation at present is that the new Member States pay too little attention to each other and so in most cases , things that could potentially be common treasures , stay hidden and others are un@@ aware of their existence .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Ö@@ ry &apos;s report is , in my opinion , an important source of proposals , enabling the Commission and Parliament to take up the challenge of enlargement .
We are also al@@ armed at the attempts at separ@@ atis@@ m on the part of certain economic interests in Santa Cruz , which are seeking to monopoli@@ se the country &apos;s energy resources .
The Member States are currently ent@@ ren@@ ched in their positions and it will be difficult to move them from those positions in time . &quot;
I talk to Parliament and , when I leave Parliament , I talk to groups of visitors .
The insi@@ stence by some Member States on one per cent of GN@@ I would depri@@ ve us of the Lisbon investment , as indeed your final proposal might have done .
Europe will either be social or will not be at all , Madam President .
Madam President , no is no .
. Mr President , I have to admit that , as recently as a couple of weeks ago , I did not believe we would ever get as close as this to adopting our Members &quot; Statute .
By this I mean firstly primary education , in order to ensure that no one feels sc@@ ared of technological progress , and secondly education on media content , which would allow young people to take a critical and creative approach to all forms of media .
The answers provided by the UK authorities satisfied the Commission and led it to decide that there were no grounds to pursue the infringement procedure .
The new members of the European Union expect concrete signals of our solidarity and not just words .
Europe is as incapable of creating jobs as the British Government is of creating jobs .
Furthermore , if this is a Parliament that is to be respected , we must apply the &quot; no taxation without representation &quot; principle and we must not go even further than Soviet planning ; to produce financial perspectives for a period of seven years would go further than the Go@@ sp@@ lan , and that is unsustainable .
I also share Prime Minister Blair &apos;s view of the social Europe .
The proposal for a regulation is designed to further un@@ tie Community aid in areas covered by ten@@ dering procedures for goods and services for the purpose of external aid .
At this painful moment , Parliament would like to express its con@@ dol@@ ences to his wife , Mrs Ad@@ went , and the whole of his family - the remaining members of his family .
Let us keep Question Time .
At a time when expectations of politicians in general are running so high , I would urge colleagues to demonstrate and prove to the citizens of Europe that we are in step with them , as we were in step with them over the weekend , and play our part in making poverty history .
It refers to an incident where Mr Bo@@ ssi actually used physical violence .
While the appreciation of the euro exchange rate in 2004 contributed to lower infl@@ ationary pressures , increases in administered prices , indirect taxes and rises in the oil price visi@@ bly affected head@@ line inflation rates .
I am not only speaking about the short @-@ term rates , but also the ten @-@ year rates .
Partic@@ ular account should be taken of the fact that it is more than five years since this legislation was embark@@ ed upon .
I also wish to compli@@ ment the Council on working with us in informal tri@@ alogue towards an agreement at first reading .
· enhanced use of renewable energy sources
In order to make it even more difficult for the in@@ experienced new Member States to obtain funding , the report rules out a more flexible application of the n + 2 rule for the Structural Funds , and provides no solution to the problem of VAT and EU co@@ financed projects .
The revised directive is intended to gather the relevant provisions of previous directives on this issue in a single document , in order to make them more workable and easier to understand for all citizens .
Finally , with reference to traffic accidents , I should like to congratulate Mrs Wallis once again on having thoroughly studied this issue , which is of great practical importance for citizens .
It is therefore enormously important that they are provided with reliable and independent information , mainly via radio stations .
This is the reality of the situation but I cannot give you any more information at this stage .
With regard to simplification , we believe the elimination of a long list of conditions imposed upon expor@@ ters and the extension of the certificate of origin solely on the basis of the added value criterion to be positive .
This is a good thing , we cannot deny it , but we are not convinced of the use@@ fulness of deleg@@ ating environmental policies to the Member States .
Yet it is precisely now , when we need to manage the Natura 2000 sites , that the European Commission is taking a step backwards .
Today , international developments in competition are forcing companies into making progress in le@@ aps and bo@@ unds , into technological modernisation , innovation , research , technology and lifelong learning .
Having commented briefly on these dramatic events of this summer which is coming to an end , I would like to call on you , now that we are back here again , to observe a minute &apos;s silence to demonstrate our solidarity with all of the victims and express our deep@@ est sympath@@ ies to them .
If Europe is based on anything , it is based on democracy and respect for the other nations and Turkey cannot bar@@ ge in and inv@@ ade this place and insu@@ lt institutions and values which Europe so@@ rely needs .
The same level of safety must be guaranteed to Europeans , no matter which Community airport they de@@ part from .
5 . Since this is a PP@@ P project , Parliament is willing to undertake financial guarantees and to share liabilities ( but of course only when it is familiar with the conc@@ ession contract and able to discuss this issue ) .
How should young people prepare themselves so that they can have access to these jobs ?
The strengthening of gender equality should be supported wholeheartedly by this Parliament , especially those elements which emphasise actions promoting gender equality that aim to combat discrimination and access to employment , career development , pay and training , and that fight the causes of poverty and social exclusion .
Following the refer@@ enda in France and the Netherlands , the media and society as a whole are engaging in ever more frequent discussions about &quot; the democratic crisis in Europe , &quot; &quot; the distance between the bureau@@ crats and the citizens &quot; and the fact that &quot; people &apos;s real lives are being ignored . &quot;
However , communicating with European citizens is a task that goes far beyond the Commission &apos;s remit .
That concludes Question Time .
What clear legal basis is there inside this European Union ?
When I spec@@ ulate as to which sectors of the European economy might , in the years to come , make an outstanding contribution to growth and the creation of jobs , tourism is the first that springs to mind .
Wor@@ se conditions are also being created for the workers in the tourism sector , which already has more than its share of problems due to seas@@ on@@ ality and the un@@ accountability which prev@@ ails with the introduction of even more flexible forms of work .
Nonetheless , in all cases it is necessary to continue actively to make progress , to continue research and to ensure that the public authorities work to effectively guarantee the health of men and women .
Mr Bösch is here who in fact did a report a couple of years ago on this subject and I think he will want to talk further on this .
Mr President , in the few seconds that are available to me I would like to raise the question of children with special educational needs .
We should be realistic : only a strategy with a clear financial framework and a budget line will succeed in establishing its status .
In the light of China &apos;s new rules in religious matters that took effect on 1 March this year , they are exposed to a wave of random government repression , including cruel distur@@ ban@@ ces of services , hef@@ ty fines , arre@@ sts , destruction of private houses and be@@ atings or re@@ prim@@ ands along the lines of &quot; teachers cannot believe in Christian@@ ity . &quot;
Since 1963 , Syria has operated under a state of perpet@@ ual emergency , which is the legal basis for many of the repressive instruments imposed by the government and which it justi@@ fies on the grounds of the ongoing conflict with Israel following Syria &apos;s loss of the Gol@@ an Hei@@ ghts in 1967 and the struggle against Islam@@ ist terrorists who oppose the secular socialist state .
Even as a young girl , I knew the following pro@@ ver@@ b : &quot; The number of languages you speak is the number of times you are human . &quot;
I should like to take this opportunity to praise the IRA for taking risks when others shi@@ r@@ ked their responsibilities .
.
I would certainly be in favour of a sunset clause , about which everything has in any case already been said , and I hope that Mr Rad@@ wan &apos;s report gets through in such a shape as to maintain the balance he is seeking .
It is also important for the employees of the financial institutions .
In that respect , I endorse the clause setting 1 April 2008 as the &quot; sunset , &quot; as also stipulated in the Rad@@ wan report .
I ask that this sens@@ ational achievement be recorded in today &apos;s minutes .
Under the latest Commission proposals for land transport public service obligations , public administrations will be given flexibility over ten@@ dering processes and will be able to award certain services to in @-@ house operators directly .
I welcome the rapporteurs &apos; proposals on that point .
It is through such an all @-@ emb@@ racing approach by EU policies , enhanced by the territorial component and with subsidiarity maintained , that we will be able to move the EU a significant step further down the road towards becoming a Union of all citizens .
On the issue of establishing a system for assessing the impact of the various Community policies on territorial cohesion within the Union , it is true that current impact assessment does not take into account territorial cohesion issues .
Commissioner , a few weeks ago I under@@ went the experience of being denied boarding by one of the main European national airlines , and the rights that were read to me then were not in line with the rules approved by this European Parliament .
If it is the case that the European Union is taking a gam@@ ble on their future accession , it is because we also believe that it is in our best interests and that it will benefit our fellow citizens .
But , as usual , Brussels will pl@@ ough on .
Given how much we pour out here in the EU , we should easily be able to fill the glass .
Mr Barón Crespo raised an issue which frankly I expected we might have heard more of in the course of the debate today , which is the centrali@@ ty of the World Trade Organization talks , just ten working weeks away , in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals .
Could an inquiry be carried out into these Agreements ?
The debate is closed .
We have a particularly high regard for the way this , the world &apos;s largest democracy , is trying , through legislation , actively to recti@@ fy the defects observ@@ able in its society .
Speci@@ fic action in this regard must be taken across the whole Union , with due consideration for international cooperation .
The fear that the ES@@ B could switch off the lights at any time causes the regulators to take a sof@@ tly , sof@@ tly approach to the opening up of the market .
Mr President , I will be fairly brief , but that is not to say that I am under@@ estim@@ ating this problem , which is a major one .
That involves setting up a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules .
That is something different .
I take the liberty of supporting Mrs Lucas &quot; request , because the resu@@ mption of the debate this afternoon is going to pose a problem for a number of my fellow Members who were scheduled to speak : some of them have an aer@@ op@@ lane to catch , others have appointments .
Above all else , Beijing wants to promote its own activity whereby it does not hesitate to stimulate price harmonisation or to du@@ mp temporary surpluses on the world market .
In fact , this was the first Mediterranean country with which we have signed an association agreement within the context of the process of Euro @-@ Mediterranean integration .
The Slovak side has doubts about the im@@ parti@@ ality of the court proceedings against this Slovak citizen and about the observation of relevant European legal standards .
This is the only strategic solution .
We are talking about women and men , often accompanied by children , who have taken the painful decision to leave their countries .
The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 3 October confirmed that the EU remains firmly united around the European Union E@@ 3 Troika approach .
A possible military intervention , however , similar to that initiated by the Americans against Iran &apos;s neighbours , Iraq and Afghanistan , in recent years , would give the people in Iran the feeling that their country is being threatened from outside and should therefore be defended .
Such a solution would help create the climate for a better relationship with Europe and with the wider international community .
I therefore call on the European Parliament to go and ask those who are enligh@@ tened , to ask the prof@@ essors ; I call on you to go to the library and find out what language Arist@@ ot@@ le , Pro@@ tag@@ or@@ as and Demo@@ cri@@ tus wrote in , what language Alexand@@ ra the Great spoke and for justice to be done at long last .
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that these goals must not be seen as sac@@ ro@@ sanc@@ t , because if , by any chance , we do not achieve them , there will be a sense of desper@@ ation and failure and we will be back to square one , which will be an extremely harmful outcome .
There is no question that it is late in coming , but better late then never .
Regarding the election , we must keep faith with the facts observed by the European Union observation mission and the Car@@ ter Center , which are that the process leading up to the 15 May was well run , but that the process after 15 May had some irregularities .
He made sure that his friends in the horse racing business did not have to pay tax on six @-@ figure @-@ a @-@ go stu@@ d fees .
Hon@@ ourable members of the Chinese National People &apos;s Congress , you will be aware that dialogue between Europe and China is of crucial importance in terms of continuing globalisation .
Conc@@ erns about the use of nuclear weapons by a country that is a leading prop@@ on@@ ent of Islamic fundamentalism are certainly well @-@ founded .
The following amendments have been proposed :
The extent to which a country recognises this right is an indication of its level of democracy .
The associated loss of productivity , together with increased health care costs , amount to around 4 % of GDP .
This raises the question of why , in Iraq , the British and Americans have encouraged the adoption of a constitution which enshr@@ ines Sh@@ aria law and will severely cur@@ b the freedom of many women .
This means that no corner of the globe is safe from the threat .
The Erasmus programme ow@@ es a great deal to her ten@@ acity , and the budget increase that she is calling for fully reflects her commitment .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
It takes on board the experience of the previous ones and seeks to adopt the most appropriate solutions on the basis of that experience .
I thank Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ oura for his listening skills and for the quality of the dialogue that we have been able to establish .
This programme , furthermore , is essential for facing the challenge of enlargement and also in terms of developing an awareness of European citizenship , because only through the dissemination of our common cultural values can we illustrate the different foundations of our European identity .
. Mr President , it is clear that the strength of European culture does not , indeed cannot , lie in its buildings and its c@@ athed@@ r@@ als .
Climate @-@ friendly alternatives exist for almost all applications , or are in development .
Given that it was possible to find equ@@ itable solutions in other situations , of which the posting of workers directive is but one example , the Commission remains convinced that it is possible to reconcile the four freedoms under the European Treaties with the different social models chosen by the Member States .
As Commissioner for the Internal Market , he has a duty to defend it against its de@@ trac@@ tors .
In both cases , the Member States adopted their own policies , sometimes with opposite effects .
The idea of that regulation is to reimbur@@ se the cost of use of an@@ tivi@@ r@@ als or vaccines in the event of a pan@@ demic .
The third principle is developing partnerships with countries of origin in the management of flows , including policies of co @-@ development .
At the same time , however , it is hard to view the regulation in isolation from the list of priority projects included with the proposed measures .
- Mr President , the construction of trans @-@ European transport and energy networks is of enormous significance for the EU , and in particular for the 10 new Member States .
New substances are being authorised and , very importantly , the positive list of permitted additives needs to be revised .
The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of EU enlargement , by fully integrating representatives from the new EU Member States into the EU institutions , as well as preparations for the next round of EU enlargement , when Bulgaria and Romania will join .
Because , if our businesses are not succe@@ eding , if our workforce is not competitive , if we do not put people back into jobs , what is the social dimension ?
The Hamp@@ ton Court summit must respond to these concerns ; it must send a clear signal that the European people are determined to defend their social model and therefore to stop setting it in opposition to competitiveness .
. I would certainly agree with the honourable Member that there are times of frustration and disappointment as we seek a way forward in the Middle East peace process .
This is part of striking the balance that we believe is necessary between protecting people from terrorism and serious crime and , on the other hand , respecting civil rights .
Madam President , speaking as one of the members of the delegation that was sent to observe the elections , I would like to extend the warm@@ est of thanks to our chairman Mr Salaf@@ ran@@ ca Sánchez @-@ Ne@@ y@@ ra , for the good work done by the delegation in Afghanistan , and also , of course , to Emma Bonino , who led the EU &apos;s observation mission , and to the European Union &apos;s long @-@ term observers , who did a splendid job , and are continuing to do so to some extent .
The exciting events in Lebanon and Syria and the ongoing tragic situation in Africa &apos;s last colony , Western Sahara , show that there is still a very great deal indeed to be done in the region .
The second report found that the Council has given no valid reason for continuing to legisl@@ ate behind closed doors .
However , despite Mr Diam@@ and@@ ou@@ ros &apos;s activity to inform the public , confusion continues to reign as regards the sectors of competence of the European Ombudsman .
I welcome the decision , announced today , to arrange for a Parliament delegation to visit the country next January .
. Mr President , one of the last great Tibetan lam@@ as , T@@ enz@@ in Del@@ ek Rin@@ po@@ che , has spent the past 20 years engaged in efforts to protect Tibetan culture .
The third countries took our factories and we get their inhabitants .
If we try to put a stop to globalisation , we ourselves are affected .
If the allegations are proven , then what is going on needs to be stopped immediately .
They are not even here .
What is needed is for the Heads of State or Government to be ast@@ ute enough and wise enough to provide the legal framework that is needed to make that possible .
- Mr President , the Commission work programme reflects its honourable efforts to serve , in the best possible way , the imperi@@ alist interests of the European Union and the choices of big business .
First of all , I am delighted , as Mr Dau@@ l said in his capacity as Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairman , at the cooperation that has been established between the Commission , on the one hand , and Parliament and its various committees , on the other , during the preparation of this work programme .
This led to a saving of around EUR 80 million .
Swe@@ des wishing , for example , to buy toys for their children will find that , although a few are produced in their own country , most are imported .
Although aspects that are important to me , including risk and volume @-@ based registration , have not made it to the finishing line , I still voted in favour at the final vote .
These are figures of which you simply have to take note , for they are important , not only for Germany , but also for the European Union , when it comes to maintaining jobs .
As you are aware , the EU takes a serious approach to the challenges related to mobili@@ sing the budgetary funds required to reduce poverty by half by 2015 .
Unfortunately , I do not have any stick with which to force Member States that back@@ slide to honour their obligations .
We must invite other actors to participate in this process so that we in Europe do not become the only market .
There is no one ideal solution .
This is also how one should see the European Union @-@ China and European Union @-@ India partnerships .
Secondly , developed societies are not prepared to accept a lower standard of living , and nor should this be our policy or our blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int .
We are delighted at the extent to which ministers have engaged Parliament and particularly the extent to which the British Home Secretary has ensured that Parliament is involved in taking forward that security agenda .
When we issue proposals in the coming days , setting out to partners the possible options for increasing transparency in the Council , I can assure the honourable Member , who has spoken with elo@@ qu@@ ence in terms of the importance he attaches to this issue , that we will be discussing this paper with the incoming Presiden@@ cies and also with the Council Sec@@ retariat .
I have some military training ; what surprised me was that , most of the time , I was not being taught to kill , but rather to protect myself against arms .
The relevant approaches to this should be sought .
The European taxpayer does not deserve this .
In conclusion , let me say that I am looking forward to discussing these and other questions again , in the high @-@ level inter@@ parliamentary conference in early December in Brussels .
Mr President , the Commission takes note of the position taken by Parliament and will not hesitate to draw all the necessary conclusions from a possible rejection by your Assembly , taking account of the Council &apos;s position as well .
The fact that the PPE @-@ DE Group and Union for Europe of the Nations Group have declared here that they can still endorse the proposal , given that the Council and the required qualified majority in this House will ensure that the licensing provisions will not survive at second reading , is reason enough for the two representatives of the Dutch Socialist Party to vote against the proposal .
We also regret the rejection of proposals tabled by our group aimed at setting up a European disarmament agency , condemning the USA &apos;s manipulation of the United Nations , making Europe a nuclear weapon @-@ free zone , with@@ drawing the USA &apos;s nuclear weapons from Europe , and calling on Germany to eliminate its uranium enrich@@ ment potential in the G@@ arch@@ ing research re@@ actor .
We would like to see more coordination on the part of the Commission and the Council and more co @-@ decision for Parliament .
I would therefore like , on behalf of the European Parliament , to thank the millions of volunteers throughout the world who are working to eradicate this pla@@ gue .
This is an important issue , and it will be important at Hong Kong that we reach agreement on an interim package of measures for developing countries , as proposed by Commissioner Mandelson .
Governments and citizens in Europe need to believe that structural change and possible job losses in agriculture will be balanced by the creation of new jobs and new opportunities in other sectors .
The rules for special and differ@@ ential treatment must be strengthened .
In this context , the Council welcomes and strongly supports the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its 60@@ th session in September 2005 , which emphasises the role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals .
This happened without the use of an@@ tivi@@ ral agents , vaccines or radical measures having been taken in poultry farming , but thanks to the most effective means of disease defence called natural resistance .
Water birds are not nearly monitored enough , which is essential , after all , because the low @-@ pa@@ tho@@ genic virus is spread much more widely than imag@@ ined .
It was not in the original Treaties .
The fact is that they do not always do this .
Whatever the case , we can say that the information / communication sector boo@@ sts the development of European economy and facilitates the creation of jobs .
Some delegations reject any extension of Annex H as a matter of principle .
If you want to bring about a shift from direct to indirect taxation , which can indeed be very advantageous , you also need to differenti@@ ate the rates .
I therefore hope that , with the support of the Commission too , the Council will at last listen to the voice of the European Parliament .
I note that the report on the one @-@ stop @-@ shops and the refund of VAT generally was only referred to Parliament because of a change to the legal basis .
I am not the only one to have carried out this test .
I look forward to an early conclusion of the codecision process so that the directive can be implemented by the Member States and we can achieve a high level of environmental protection in this area .
But ask yourself this : are our fellow citizens aware of the European anti @-@ discrimination directives ?
That is unacceptable , and we cannot continue to tolerate such practices .
With the annual budget , however , we are making a positive response , and for that I am also grateful to Minister Le@@ wis and Commissioner Gr@@ y@@ b@@ aus@@ ka@@ it@@ ė .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to pay tribute to Mr Pit@@ t@@ ella , the rapporteur , and to Mr Le@@ wand@@ owski , the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets .
If we fail our citizens in this respect , ap@@ athy and their perception of the barrier between the EU institutions and ordinary citizens will grow much bigger .
Br@@ inging secondary school pupils to this institution for all @-@ expenses @-@ paid visits , during which they will be given dis@@ in@@ genu@@ ous one @-@ sided brie@@ f@@ ings about the wonders of the European Union , is a cru@@ de bra@@ in@@ washing exercise , as is the flooding of educational establishments with equally one @-@ sided literature .
The E@@ PL@@ P opinion is that this harmonisation of tax base could possibly lead to higher rates , with harmonisation at a later stage which is not desired .
The object and purpose of this measure remain unclear to this day .
The European Union has a special responsibility to insist on that through dialogue .
The next thematic strategy on the urban environment will encourage an integrated approach to the management of our cities , including urban transport .
In any case , the &quot; Euro@@ vig@@ nette Directive &quot; signi@@ fies a decision for the future , which we see as moving towards a more people @-@ friendly and environmentally friendly transport policy , as indeed it must .
If State aid is used , monitored and analysed correctly , it can be a useful tool to boost growth and job creation .
To avoid this ic@@ e@@ berg , Mr Alexander , you have to sail in the direction of the Böge report .
. Mr President , last June , the majority of Parliament warmly welcomed Mr Blair .
Mr Schulz was brave enough to acknowledge our friendship before this House , so let me further imper@@ il his reputation by saying that I also like and admire him .
Who can blame them at a time when one in ten European citizens today are out of work , in which one in twenty are long @-@ term unemployed ?
It had the wi@@ dest possible support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and I regret that the GUE / NGL Group has chosen to re @-@ table amendments that were rejected by the committee .
As it is Christmas , I should like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council for his handling of Question Time and his wi@@ t .
Sustainable catching methods with minimal by@@ catch and sound monitoring are essential .
Too many boats taking too few fish is the cry .
Lastly , the setting up and maintaining of regional advisory coun@@ cils ( R@@ AC@@ s ) are key to the new CFP .
Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Fisheries for its report on this proposal from the Commission .
There were 1.@@ 5@@ 79 offences in Portugal ; three of them were dealt with by criminal sanctions .
It is difficult to know if this increase in the infringements detected means that the rate of detection of serious infringements is improving or if the number of infringements committed has increased .
I must stress how important this resolution is now that the Sakharov Prize has been awarded and given that we in this House emphasised yesterday that freedom of expression - a fundamental right - and freedom of the press must be a part of all our activities , particularly when we have agreements with partner countries .
The Chinese Government must listen to our calls for respect for human rights .
There is , at the moment , no independent judiciary , there is no free television , and the political opposition has been totally margin@@ alised .
All too often , hom@@ ophobia is justified under the banner of other fundamental rights , namely freedom of religion and freedom of opinion .
- The fact that we are having this debate is important , but more important still is taking urgent and effective measures to put a stop to the trafficking of human beings , and in particular women and children , for the purposes of sexual exploitation and enforced labour ; this is t@@ ant@@ amount to slavery and a grave violation of human rights .
For my part , I would like to draw attention to witness protection as a recognised method of combating organised crime .
Madam President ,
In the Inter@@ parliamentary Conference , we succeeded in getting geographical indications forward .
New joint measures will also be needed at European Union level .
Under this directive , Liverpool &apos;s communities , which are already among the most deprived in Europe , will witness hard @-@ gra@@ fting do@@ ckers being put out of work . All this with a compensation package on the table insufficient to comply with United Kingdom law , let alone the European Convention on Human Rights .
Where , in truth , are the proposals for the proper layout of ports ?
It is unacceptable that these high standards should be ero@@ ded by the adv@@ ent of market operators bound by less stringent rules .
That concludes the first voting session of 2006 .
All the items mentioned in the report have already been covered by UK legislation , and it is these laws which should be utili@@ sed fully rather than to create yet more EU legislation , which would have resulted in negative consequences .
Close cooperation in the energy field and the possibility of sharing energy reserves constitute one of the most effective and indispensable confidence @-@ building measures both within the Union and between the Union and its neighbourhood .
While there are many excellent NGOs and pressure groups , which bring to our attention legitimate concerns on environmental matters and act as watch@@ dogs holding the institutions to account on our behalf , I would urge caution in allowing any self @-@ legitim@@ ising group to put an added burden on the institutions and clo@@ g up an already over@@ bur@@ dened justice system .
Most of us here probably agree , at heart , with the Commission &apos;s proposal - that new market instruments are necessary , for example ec@@ ot@@ a@@ xes and the intern@@ alisation of all costs .
Before our very eyes , a decision has been taken by politicians to construct the largest energy network of its kind , incorporating a double gas pipeline and a system of electric cables , along the bottom of the Baltic Sea .
It is not right that we should have to extract all our resources from the national budgets , which are already under pressure .
List@@ ening to you , one has the impression that it is a real pleasure to sit on the European Council , that it is great to be President of the Council , a truly noble calling .
Mr Schulz and I were in London just a day before Hamp@@ ton Court , and there the Socialist leaders , presidents and prime ministers decided unanimously to bring before the European Union a new common growth strategy , recognising that we cannot achieve it merely by means of a European Union directive - we do not have the necessary competences .
I have , however , felt it necessary to reject a resolution that is not mine and which , above all , contains paragraphs that in my view are in@@ consistent with the purpose of the document itself .
The report was endorsed by every member of the Committee , with no votes against , and four ab@@ sten@@ tions .
I therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament , because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options .
There is a definite sense of law@@ lessness that per@@ v@@ ades Chechnya and the whole of the northern Caucasus .
There are a growing number of ab@@ duc@@ tions , abuses and random kill@@ ings .
We must do a lot more in this field .
We must simply distinguish here , however , between those for whom this policy represents the prospect of European membership , on the one hand , and those with whom we wish to have permanent associations as neighbours , such as the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean , on the other .
We know that this will take time , but it is highly important that we are fully engaged in it .
That is the only way we can be sure that the Member States will take it into account when drawing up national policies ; otherwise , we run the risk of the Charter becoming a mere list of good intentions .
The Commission and the Council should also re @-@ embark on action with regard to a Community patent , which is problematic but essential .
We are carrying out customs duties there , so it will provide scanning equipment as well as training for the Palestinians .
From that point of view , I see it as a positive development that Hamas candidates have signed the code of conduct , even though there remains a general feeling of concern at the climate of violence in which the elections will take place , particularly in Gaza .
At the same time , the EU is trying to buy its way out of anything to do with the Palestinians , for whom , in conjunction with Israel &apos;s policy of apar@@ thei@@ d , the EU and the United States are becoming entirely responsible .
It is not just about mobility , it is about all the disabilities that we have to learn to cope with in our different ways , whether it is sight , hearing , learning difficulties , resp@@ ir@@ atory problems or sei@@ zu@@ res .
La@@ ws should be approved as a common set of minimum standards which gives the member states more flexibility and possibility to have a higher level of protection of security , health , environment , working conditions , social conditions and consumer protection .
I shall now move on to food security .
At the outset I would like to thank the other 26 Members of the European Parliament on the delegation for their work , particularly my dep@@ uty chairman , Mrs Napole@@ tano , and , of course Mrs de Key@@ ser , in her capacity as chief observer of the European Union &apos;s team .
The first challenge - which I too find difficult - is to respect the Palestinian people &apos;s choice , which was , as Mr Mc@@ Mill@@ an @-@ Scott said , one in favour of change and not necessarily of radical Islam@@ ism .
Is the electoral success of Hamas likely to be a set@@ back for us ?
The people of Europe , and especially the young , must be made aware of their story and their exemplary fight for human rights .
We should not look at industry reform from the viewpoint of the postal sector as a business .
I am sure colleagues will accept that fully and thus deal with any issues about the loss of the traditional British &quot; pin@@ ta . &quot;
Moreover , the EU &apos;s institutions would not be complying with their ambition to improve the quality of legislation by avoiding detailed regulation .
We in the European Parliament must play our part in ensuring that the European Union develops with the support of its citizens and that it serves their interests in the best possible way .
In response to Mr Mark@@ ov and to Mrs Ay@@ ala , I will state that the study on the use of small lor@@ ries is under way , that we envis@@ age a meeting taking place this year with all of the interested parties and , once again , that we are going to increase the coordination between these texts and the directive on drivers &quot; working time .
On the contrary , if we follow a policy of proper handling of animals , all the protective measures , all the precau@@ tions we take are much more effective .
Mr President , first of all , I should like to add my voice in support of Mr Hö@@ k@@ mark &apos;s excellent report , which we as a group will be backing , and we also support the choice which the Commission has made in favour of less and better @-@ targeted state support , in which respect I should like to stress once again , lest we forget , that the amounts involved are actually lower .
The idea that failing national economies should be given money to protect them from global realities is like giving a bottle of whis@@ ky to an alcoholic .
We have indeed heard that Greece has drafted or is drawing up legislation , but as we have not received any official signal from the Greek authorities , we cannot give our opinion on it .
These are required because such regulations would allow for a more accurate adaptation of the general stipul@@ ations of the Framework Directive to specific situations .
Would the li@@ f@@ egu@@ ards in swimming pools be virtually wholly wra@@ pped up ?
They also demonstrate the power of the European Parliament .
It is true that this particular proposal proved rather difficult to bring to a fin@@ alisation agreement , but thanks to the per@@ sever@@ ance and the common @-@ sense approach exhi@@ bited by all involved in the conciliation process , all the hur@@ d@@ les were overcome .
As regards Parliament &apos;s involvement in negotiating or sus@@ pending an agreement , you will be well aware that these procedures are clearly established by the Treaty and reflect the interinstitutional structure of the European Union .
Parliament already plays an inv@@ alu@@ able role in focusing attention on human rights issues , through the extremely active work of the Sub@@ committee on Human Rights , through its annual report on human rights in the world and through the many resolutions and debates on particular human rights issues .
Clearly , the way people living in a country &apos;s heart@@ land and central areas perc@@ eive border issues differs from how they are perceived by people living in border regions . For the latter , the border is part of their daily lives .
First of all , on 28 January , the Ecofin Council concluded a political agreement to extend the experimental reduced VAT rate on labour @-@ intensive services until 2010 .
By using wood as a natural material , less energy is used in making the final product , while at the same time this reduces greenhouse gas emissions , and the wood retains the carbon dioxide , that has built up in the tree over a number of years .
The slogan &quot; think globally and act locally &quot; also applies here .
We doubt it .
I confirm that , following the vote on Thursday , the Commission will bring forward a revised proposal with a view to facilitating a common position as soon as possible - hopefully , before the end of April .
There are alternatives - clear and simple alternatives that do , as is intended , reduce the bureaucracy involved in cross @-@ border service provision .
Mr President , there is nothing wrong with wanting to reduce un@@ justified obstacles to the free movement of services in the internal market , provided that it is done in a responsible manner , ensuring that it does not undermine social and environmental rights , and moving towards the harmonisation of the legislation on services at European level .
Little remains of that text now . National interests have super@@ s@@ eded European ones and the principle of solidarity has been swe@@ pt aside by the ego@@ ism displayed by certain countries .
Since 2001 , the European Union has also provided Serbia @-@ Montenegro with political advice through the consul@@ tative task force , which was later replaced by the strengthened permanent dialogue in preparation for negotiations on a Stabili@@ sation and Association Agreement .
Is that a good enough reason , however , to accept this compromise ?
Nonetheless , there are limits beyond which the Services Directive would become meaning@@ less .
We cannot bury our heads in the sand , however .
In conclusion , we should explore as many ways as possible for le@@ ver@@ ing extra investment into development , but the methods we choose must have public support and they must never be cover@@ t .
Wor@@ st of all , they have infl@@ amed hatred and fear and they have gained an audience for their views .
The historical comparison drawn by Angela Merkel , too , is completely unacceptable .
The willingness and the honest intention to further intensify dialogue between cultures , religions , civili@@ s@@ ations and people remains a priority in this context .
The country is at present an un@@ equal federation , and un@@ workable in the long term , with the Bosni@@ an / Cro@@ at Federation dominated by the Bosni@@ ans , the Serbs and their , and the Cro@@ ats of Herzegovina , who keep themselves to themselves , but the ones who really are margin@@ alised are those Bosni@@ an Cro@@ ats who can scarcely find a place for themselves in this scheme of things .
It would appear to be clear that we shall have a reduction - and a significant reduction - from the Commission proposal .
Even if I wanted to , it is simply not in my hands at this stage .
I am no doubt looking , rather , for a political answer and political declaration .
However , we must not run the risk of this coverage against income crises taking us back to the old system of guaranteed incomes via state intervention .
I support him completely , particularly in relation to option 2 , and I welcome the Commissioner &apos;s comments this evening .
Secondly , the inter@@ service group on forestry , which was established in 2002 to facilitate cooperation and coordination of forestry @-@ related work between relevant Commission services , has proved to be an effective tool of coordination and is working very satisfac@@ tori@@ ly .
Our aim must continue to be to work together to achieve the objectives of Lisbon and Gothenburg .
That is indeed something that Europe must deal with .
It is worth not@@ ing that its particular aspects , such as the prevention of forest fires or floods , are already covered by special Community financing instruments .
Thus , a digital divide is appearing between Member States , a digital divide is appearing between regions and , most importantly , a digital divide is even appearing between persons with a small age difference .
It was very early on that we understood and took to heart the importance of social cohesion , self @-@ determination and autonomy , not only in the city @-@ states of ancient Greece but in the republi@@ cs of medieval Italy , with not only the self @-@ awareness of Spain , France , Poland and England , but also the colourful diversity of the &quot; Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation . &quot;
Now , only an exce@@ ed@@ ingly small proportion of the fund will probably be used for these purposes , however , and so the proposal is still acceptable .
I have told the Chinese and Vietnam@@ ese Governments that I want to work with them to see how they can address the concerns raised by the EU investigation .
The cy@@ nic in me suggests that these statistics were swe@@ pt under the carpet in order to end the &quot; bra wars , &quot; another sti@@ cking pla@@ ster when the EU needs long @-@ term solutions .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this issue .
The European arrest warrant on its own is not an adequate tool for the creation of a European area of security , freedom and justice , nor will we achieve its proper application unless we substantially strengthen mutual trust between judges , unless we apply minimum common rules to criminal proceedings which safeguard sus@@ pects &apos; fundamental rights and unless we achieve a ru@@ di@@ mentary approxim@@ ation of national laws .
Last week , the US Secretary of State revealed that the Administration is to request a further 75 million dollars to promote democracy in Iran .
We reach a very small number of questions , and answers are allowed to go on forever .
In the communication , the Commission outlined a set of recommendations for the Member States , since the European Union does not have any formal power or competence in this area .
This is also emphasised by the report pres@@ ently under discussion .
I support most of these amendments and ear@@ ne@@ stly hope that the Financial Regulation , as amended by the European Commission and Parliament , will enable funds set aside in the 2007 @-@ 2013 Financial Perspective to be distributed in a more efficient and transparent manner than has been the case to date .
Now they want to score points with the right wing , and so they took this action .
They could hold a press conference with 500 journalists in there .
Europe &apos;s economic future depends on having the best educated and trained people , with a full range of skills and the adap@@ tability required for a knowledge economy .
What are the real questions ?
I c@@ eded my place to Commissioner Rehn for the Western Balkans debate and now , if you permit me , I shall say a few words on yesterday &apos;s events .
The creation of a Human Rights Council is without doubt the best solution available to the problem of the UN Commission whose integrity has been com@@ promised .
We are making good this short@@ coming , and I also think that this makes sense .
Ec@@ ologists and economists have calculated that the value of the free services provided by nature amounts to the incredible sum of approximately EUR 23 billion a year , which is more than the combined national product of the entire world .
We already have 260 signatures , and we need 80 more , so please let us have yours .
First , we continue to subsidi@@ se tobacco growing in the EU .
If the further reduction you want were to become reality , it would mean we only had one third of the previous funding for what will be 27 states .
Democracy and human rights : these are the values for which we all stand .
We have made a correct step in the right direction in this respect , too , but we , here in Parliament , are not currently satisfied with the budget .
This includes concrete contributions to peace , sustainable development , respect for human rights and the development and strengthening of democracy throughout the world .
I am sure I do not need to tell you that the work of the EU Special Representative for the African Great L@@ akes Region , Al@@ do Aj@@ ello , is extremely important for the stabilisation of the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
We under@@ took , together with the ACP countries , to implement the Millennium Development Goals and , further to Mr Corn@@ il@@ let &apos;s reference to respect for taxpayers , I want to say that we need to value the implementation and control mechanisms both in our institutions and in the benefici@@ ary states .
Sometimes bold steps have to be taken , which means we must at the same time make sure that the eventual outcome of negotiations on agreements leaves sufficient time for ACP domestic and regional markets to adapt .
Do you want our markets to be a totally liberal free @-@ for @-@ all or to be regulated with protection for vulnerable people ?
To a certain extent , therefore , it is still engaged in the process of its own development as a party .
I , as a P@@ ole , know this only too well .
It must be pointed out that , over the last few years , it was those very countries that took an intelligent approach to drafting new tax policies that went on to obtain good results ; one interesting example is France .
I believe that we must not miss this opportunity .
The intention is , then , that the European political parties should serve the purpose of si@@ ph@@ oning off yet more pil@@ es of money from the taxpayer and give even more of it to political parties , but only , that is , to the politically correct ones .
It is the duty of a democracy to look ahead for an answer to challenges that it knows are un@@ avoidable .
Commissioner Kro@@ es takes care of the competition part and Commissioner McCreevy takes care of the internal market side .
The Commission delegation in Geneva will also provide the support we usually offer to MEPs on the ground when they are on official business abroad .
It was during the past year that the Commission first presented them , and I am grateful to your House for giving them such close attention , for they will be a guide - not only during this year but also there@@ after - to what we are considering doing and to the basis on which we will be doing it .
Also important is the call for what is known as &quot; smart growth strategy . &quot; This strategy should consolidate the different approaches to EU economic policy into a consistent strategy .
Mr President , as I take the floor in this debate , I should like to point out that some of the recommendations to Member States contained in the reports will not be beneficial to economic growth and employment in the European Union .
The symboli@@ sm was clear and , standing there , I felt strongly that people did not feel that they were entering something new but felt that they were being re@@ united with something of which they had always been a part .
. The explanatory statement to Mr Li@@ pi@@ etz &apos;s report is much more instruc@@ tive than the report itself , which contents itself with he@@ ap@@ ing praise on the Commission &apos;s &apos; remarkable &apos; work in hunting down the sligh@@ test hin@@ d@@ rance to free competition .
Like certain Nobel economics prize @-@ winners , we feel that free trade can only benefit all sides when it is between countries at the same level of development , and that trade between other countries needs to be regulated ; this , by the way , does not rule out favourable trade provisions for the developing countries .
It is , however , inc@@ umb@@ ent on the Commission to make radical changes to its policy towards countries that are blat@@ antly infring@@ ing Community law on the freedom to provide services .
Some of our regions suffer because they are very spar@@ sely populated and that means that infrastructure costs are very high .
We need to promote measures to remember the mass de@@ port@@ ations and the victims of both Naz@@ ism and Stal@@ in@@ ism - I repeat , and Stal@@ in@@ ism .
It is his first report , it is a big report and he has done an excellent job in raising all the key issues .
This is also a topic very close to the previous one .
In this respect , I should like to re@@ submit the proposal that I put forward in this House during the debate on the Qu@@ ei@@ r@@ ó report : to create a European capital of tourism .
The joint draft of the European Parliament and of the Council , which was approved by the Conciliation Committee on 31 January 2006 , provides that Member States may retain national requirements stricter than those foreseen by the Regulation until the end of 2012 .
Yet what we have in front of us is a regulation with a legal base that casts doubt on the ongoing right of Austria and Denmark to keep their stricter national laws beyond six years and that will actively work against the ability of other Member States to adopt them .
You can see that certain Members of Parliament are wearing scar@@ ves bearing colours intended to express this support vis@@ ually and I must tell you that , thanks to the reform that we promoted recently and which is now in force , the President can allow the presence of these external symbols .
European Investment Bank funds act as cat@@ alysts for public and private investors in research and technological development , as well as trans @-@ European networks and small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
Mr Barroso , you need to go back to the days of Dr Sal@@ az@@ ar in order to find that principle , when the United States , in 100 years , has only had 38 balanced budgets .
A new government is being formed in Kiev , but I am confident that whatever its composition , it will remain committed to European integration .
I should like to thank the representatives of all the political groups who participated in the observation mission and spent time in Ukraine recently .
Commissioner , would you subscribe to the view that this is something that the Commission should do in order to try to deal with this crisis , which is what this evening &apos;s debate is all about ?
For that reason among others , and also in order to ro@@ b refugees of the illusion that they can enter the EU illegally , I have voted against this resolution .
The challenge , one where the Turkish authorities are failing , is to separate the die @-@ hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution .
The Turkish authorities can then respond in a spirit of goodwill .
There is also a little co@@ da to this , on which the Commissioner will be reporting in a few weeks &quot; time .
Following a great many debates , even you , Madam President , in your current capacity as Chair of this House , will be well aware of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament , given that we have debated and approved it within the Committee on Legal Affairs and twice over in this Chamber .
This would enable the affected regions - including candidate and associate states - to actually perc@@ eive the fact that Europe helps .
Again , Parliament should call on the Court of Auditors not to permit the use of official cars for private purposes .
It is not only that our pensions system has no legal basis and is not paid for out of our salaries . It is also badly regulated and has huge deficits paid for by the taxpayers .
Mr President , in the light of the serious allegations concerning the rent and purchase by the European Parliament of two buildings in Strasbourg , this House must emphasise that it is taking immediate steps to investigate these allegations in a prompt , rigorous and transparent manner .
That being said , I am not opposed to development per se .
In a sense , therefore , this is a kind of experiment , and it is never possible to predict the results of an experiment during its initial stages .
I sincerely hope that the Member States will consent to the use of the broad scope of technology , again , of course , without this being at the expense of safety .
And by learning foreign languages we also become acquain@@ ted with a nation &apos;s culture , its history and its land and this also contributes to greater mutual respect .
If that cannot be done or if we cannot agree to it , I move that , as an alternative , the vote be de@@ ferred to the next plenary part @-@ session .
The purpose of this report is to update , rec@@ ast and consolidate the rules on animal health in relation to the trade in aqu@@ aculture products , including the prevention and control of certain diseases , and in turn to increase the competitiveness of European aqu@@ aculture producers .
It is true that oil and natural resources were nation@@ alised twice during the last millennium .
During the same presentation , Mr Barroso also spoke about a citizens &apos; agenda , with greater solidarity between citizens in future .
. - Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Verheugen &apos;s initiative towards bringing about a marked improvement in European law@@ making , which will involve with@@ drawing 68 pending legislative proposals , hits the mark in no uncertain fashion .
Something else that I am very happy about - and another thing that Mr Ma@@ at was involved in - is that we will now be having special measures to ensure that the re@@ sto@@ cking of f@@ ry can continue .
We need the fishermen , because they know the subject better than anyone and , at the same time , we need their consent and their cooperation to ensure the measures are more effective .
Again , with regard to what Mr Sch@@ ly@@ ter , Mr Hu@@ d@@ gh@@ ton , Mr Gu@@ erre@@ ir@@ o and others said on the question as to whether Morocco can conclude agreements that concern the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara , the United Nations legal adv@@ iser gives a clear answer .
Do you really think that these proposals are going to recre@@ ate a climate of trust between the citizens and Europe ?
It is our goal to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members in 2007 and it is our duty , as the guardian of the Treaties , to ensure that once they join they really meet the conditions .
People talk of corruption , of reforming the judiciary , of the situation of children , human trafficking and so on .
If conditions laid down as binding in the accession treaties are not met , then the application of these rules does not amount to discrimination against a country , but is nothing other than the fulfilment of an agreement between the contracting parties .
I have on many occasions pointed out in this Chamber how dangerous it would be for us to trivi@@ alise this clause or to use it as a pretext for drawing attention to a variety of real concerns and one @-@ off causes of dis@@ satisfaction , so rather losing sight of the overall picture .
Its treatment of the Kur@@ ds and of women and its attitudes to , for example , freedom of expression show that we should not have done so .
Mr President , yes , it will end in te@@ ars ; the question is , which ?
That is what matters and we must believe that the democratic forces will win .
As I said in my answer to the first question , we should look upon the issues in our trade negotiations .
This was followed by a conditional vote of no @-@ confidence and one of the key results was that food safety was taken away from DG Agriculture and became an area of policy that falls within the codecision procedure .
Why would it be helpful to have identical power points throughout the European Union ?
The candidate proposed to us clearly meets those criteria .
This is an important tool , because responding in humanitarian situations is precisely what the public expects of the EU .
I am convinced that an important dimension of European solidarity is practical solidarity in the form of cohesion policy .
I@@ o@@ ann@@ ina has a place in Europe &apos;s living history , since it was there , before the enlargement to fifteen Member States , that , under your direction , the Union &apos;s Ministers for Foreign Affairs reached a memorable agreement that facilitates decision @-@ making .
I am delighted that access to this financing has been extended beyond the traditional beneficiaries that are usually referred to as &apos; European standards organisations &quot; and will include more activities .
This does not , however , constitute a connection .
What we are concerned with here is the issue of the flat tax Some of the new Member States have recently introduced a new tax system in which the tax rates for enterprises are far lower than those of the old Member States .
Moreover , it is important for the Union to improve reliability of the energy supply ( we are also speaking from our own point of view ) and reduce dependence on single suppliers .
I believe that the EU is developing in the right direction here : in the direction of cooperation , and of approaching the global energy market with our eyes open .
Parliament should not allow its powers to be cur@@ ta@@ iled in this way .
The new programmes have a potential that can only be properly har@@ ness@@ ed by improving procedures .
The challenges related to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy mean that the urban dimension of cohesion policy is gaining particular significance .
We agree with the mitig@@ ation of damages suffered , and we pressed for the rapid activation of the system .
Furthermore , as has been said , the European Union must contribute to the peace process , providing assistance for demo@@ bili@@ sation and economic aid for development and humanitarian programmes and also sending electoral and human rights observers .
Unlike harmonisation , which is based on absolute values and which den@@ ies the differences in Europe , convergence is about setting minimum and maximum levels , a range of values ; it is about creating a framework in which the various Member States of the Union must operate and modern@@ ise their economies .
I am therefore going to propose to you , Mr Verhofstadt - and you can do this , because you are the Prime Minister of your country - that one day you carry out the following test , in order to demonstrate what life would be like for the citizens if Europe did not exist ; you could , for example , on 29 May or 1 June , install border posts between your country and France and between your country and the Netherlands , and at those posts you could put customs officers who could ask the French or Dutch citizens for their pas@@ sports and tell them that their French car insurance was not valid in Belgium and that they have to take out a green card .
Therefore , Mr Verhofstadt , I should like to welcome you , and to thank you for the vision you presented both in your book and here in Parliament .
The second aspect on which I should like to elaborate , very briefly , of course , is the social aspect .
The European Union also needs to accept that the neo@@ liberalisation doctrine is of no benefit to the citizens , that a foreign policy linked to Ν@@ Α@@ Τ@@ Ο rather than to the principles of the UN is not a just policy .
What we have heard today should have been heard over the last four years .
It is apparent that she has put in a great deal of effort , commitment and skill .
It could not have been more on time .
We can only build European citizenship if we recognise this diversity and if everyone agrees on the same common project for Europe .
Following last January &apos;s energy crisis , the constant rise in the price of a bar@@ rel of cru@@ de , amongst other factors , has re@@ opened an in @-@ depth debate on the lack of a common energy policy within the Union , the vulnerability of our supply system , the worrying increase in protectionist attitudes and the need to substantially improve our habits , as well as the efficiency of our consumption .
Many women &apos;s organisations are carrying out campaigns to increase awareness amongst the citizens .
This will create the necessary flexibility to allow for differing circumstances in the Member States .
A@@ spi@@ rations are just a fig@@ ment of Brussels &quot; imagination .
As a result , major impetus was given to trying to resolve some of the problems in certain States .
With this directive we must be able to ensure that inten@@ tionally or un@@ inten@@ tionally harmful substances cannot get into ground@@ water .
Many people this evening have mentioned the Nit@@ rates Directive , which dates back to 1991 .
This proposal has its sights on both information that is required to monitor the state of the environment and information improving that state .
As envisaged in the report , it should be per@@ missible to lev@@ y charges for the transmission of data .
Climate changes are also playing a major role , with greater periods of drought and greater occurrence of intensive loc@@ alised pre@@ cip@@ itation .
If there is any area in which we can expect global economic development and our own population trends to generate vigorous growth , that area is certainly tourism .
The Commission and the European Centre for Dis@@ ease Pre@@ vention and Control are already doing an extremely important job by testing existing national pan@@ demic prevention plans and carrying out exercises .
- The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on human rights in Tunisia .
Freedom of association - albeit within certain limits - is enshrined in the Tuni@@ sian constitution ; as is so often the case with human rights issues , the law or the constitution is very much up to standard , but what matters is the way these are implemented and enforced .
On 2 June 2006 - just two weeks ago - the Commission submitted to the Tuni@@ sian authorities the draft internal regulation of the abo@@ v@@ em@@ en@@ tioned sub@@ committee and is awaiting a reply from the Tuni@@ sian side .
At the summit , there was a very open , frank and substantive discussion with President Putin on energy .
We must continue to look for a common denom@@ in@@ ator in respect of this cooperation .
I have two concrete pragmatic questions for the Commission and Council .
Moreover , the new jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would improve the safeguards against the grant of patents in error to a computer program .
Commissioner , very briefly , I know you want to er@@ r on the side of caution and you refer to reme@@ dies , but you must realise , of course , that you are the most important gu@@ ar@@ ant@@ or of prices remaining affordable for Belgian consumers and for Belgian enterprises who buy gas and electricity .
I want to underline that the Commission is fully engaged in the effort to combat extremism of all types through its overall efforts to address the root causes of dis@@ content and to promote peace , stability and security through its development cooperation and assistance .
. - Mr President , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats attaches great importance to common guarantees for the protection of privacy at Union level .
Until we have the results of this study the Commission will direct all of its energies towards monitoring the implementation of existing directives by the Member States , in the interests of the highest possible levels of justice .
A number of external -@@ policy issues will be addressed at the European Council and declarations made on them : on the Western Balkans , Iran , Iraq , Lebanon and the Middle East , respectively ; and the EU Strategy for Africa will also feature on the agenda .
Then , above all , Europe must become more united and more vigorous in defending our common interests .
Let us think of those who have started the pa@@ inst@@ aking process of climbing the stairs .
If that is the case , what can we do to make sure it comes into force ?
In a way , it seems that nationals of the EU are treated worse than nationals of third countries , whom we insist on keeping in the State where they were convic@@ ted , in the name of avoiding double jeop@@ ar@@ dy .
What we need is a complete change of course .
The environmental and social dimensions should be integrated into our understanding of sustainability as elements of equal value .
More money is also going to research into carbon @-@ based energy and to research into other non @-@ sustainable forms of energy .
These people with racial ma@@ dness , religious ma@@ dness , were the fire@@ brands of the first half of the 20th century .
It is also the intention that this agreement should , in harmony with the timetable for the development of the single area of freedom , security and justice , ensure that people can cross borders law@@ fully and without problems and stay legally in both areas .
Mr President , let me begin with , as we say in the Irish language - meaning &quot; a few words &quot; - on the title of this report .
We shall carefully scrut@@ in@@ ise it , to see how serious the Commission really is about fighting fraud .
I propose removing the second part of the sixth in@@ dent and adding it to the introduc@@ tory phrase , so that the call to pun@@ ish those responsible applies to all the national authorities .
However , this bottle of wine from California tells you more about wine on a label three in@@ ches square - that is 10 cm - than most people will ever need to know , including the fact that it was mat@@ ured in American oak for 12 months .
Everyone around the table in the European Council recognised that the case for institutional change has not changed ; it is just as pressing as when national leaders put their signatures to the Constitutional Treaty .
These gaps are being discussed quite intensi@@ vely in America , with decisions being made by the highest courts .
Di@@ versity , a source of mutual openness and wealth , is the genuine meaning of European unity and a genuine counter @-@ balance to the homo@@ gen@@ ising tendencies of globalisation .
The European framework for corporate governance should create the appropriate institutional conditions to support long @-@ term viability for companies and employment prospects , define mechanisms preventing bad management and guarantee transparency and responsibility in terms of investments and revenue .
Mr President , we like to proc@@ laim the growth of cheap air travel as a European success story .
That coup d &quot; é@@ tat did not just lead to a long and cruel civil war in Spain , therefore , but it also put an end to that hope for Europe that André Mal@@ rau@@ x had spoken of .
In addition , Parliament managed to link financing for projects to access for people with disabilities .
. - This debate is vitally important , but it will be even more so if it yields measures to ensure that it is not always the workers and the people who have to bear the br@@ unt of restructuring and relocation of businesses and large economic groups with profits in the millions , as has happened in Portugal .
Firstly , what can be done to prevent the closure of the Az@@ am@@ bu@@ ja factory ?
You will probably know that just yesterday the Prime Minister of Finland confirmed , at our meeting in Helsinki , his full determination and the determination of the Finnish Presidency to hold further discussions , starting with the informal Council of Interior Ministers , which will take place in Tampere at the end of the September .
The Union must have its own part to play too .
External relations regarding energy are also on the agenda at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lah@@ ti .
I would also like to express my solidarity with Mr Frattini , who has been attacked by Mr Catania : any possible personal liability cannot involve the Institu@@ tions .
The US Supreme Court has recently said that in the prisons of Guantánamo and Kabul , where so @-@ called unlawful comb@@ at@@ ants are fest@@ ering , Washington is not only holding them un@@ law@@ fully , it is keeping them in prison in breach of both US and international law .
I think that we will then have to create an instrument to provide constant monitoring of the initiatives that we will be adopting in a few days &quot; time ; then we will need a second meeting , this time under the a@@ eg@@ is of the African Union .
In Toronto , the countries involved must also be able to make it clear that they are serious about global and cohe@@ sive policy on HIV / AIDS .
These consist mainly of support for NGO activities , but also of direct aid to the harmonisation of standards at work .
The Director @-@ General , Mr Lamy , told us that it was the moment of truth and , as he himself has said , the result we are faced with is that we are in crisis .
However , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , there is support for the essence - the principle - of our proposal .
That is in an effort to ensure that nobody would interpret recital C as justi@@ fying the setting @-@ up of radical Islamic courts with a view to restoring order .
I call upon you as the President of this House to express to the Turkish Government your deep concern and strong condemnation of these arre@@ sts , which constitute a blat@@ ant attempt to severely cur@@ tail freedom of expression in an EU Member State .
This is an area precious to Scotland &apos;s natural environment .
How will it affect the climate , biodiversity , underground a@@ qui@@ fers and the Natura 2000 areas that have been devast@@ ated ?
Let us remember that fact , whilst also remin@@ ding ourselves of what we can do better in the future .
Rap@@ e , in full view of sp@@ ouses , was a common occurrence .
Ta@@ x@@ ation cannot be the only solution .
The Council thereby re@@ confirmed its belief that it is very important for general budgetary discipline to be observed at EU level in the way it is at national level .
As I see it , the main challenges , not least for the EU &apos;s internal market , are the abolition of poverty , the removal of social divisions , and energe@@ tic action to protect the climate .
Another political problem that particularly catches the eye is the wind@@ fall profits which electricity companies have made .
All too often these plans are coming in late and they are coming in la@@ x .
I cannot answer this question without knowledge of the specific case .
What are we talking about ?
The question rightly mentions three problem areas . The first is the fight against counter@@ feit medicines within the European Union .
This should be turned into a kind of help desk with a website where one in four Europeans and their families can seek help when they suffer from mental health problems .
What are needed in order to treat these neuro@@ logical illnesses are what Mr Bo@@ wis calls for : hospitals , individual care , specialised services and a variety of health care personnel - in other words , investment , which is something prohibited by the budgetary austerity pact in the name , of course , of the ideology of competitiveness and free trade .
Nevertheless , I should like to turn to the oral questions .
Croatia is now negotiating with the EU about membership ; Macedonia has received candidate @-@ member status and clear progress has also been made with regard to Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina .
.
We have the Barcelona process and we must use it to the full .
This summer , they have shown what they are capable of .
We need to use intermedi@@ aries , such as Turkey , to help with that dialogue and speed up temporary assistance to the Palestinian people .
It would be a tragic wasted opportunity if the reinforced UN@@ IF@@ IL merely became a b@@ yst@@ ander while H@@ iz@@ bollah pre@@ pa@@ res for its next attacks in the months and years ahead .
At the same time , we have to recognise that China is also a dictatorship .
For no reason that I can understand , the report does not take a position on the One @-@ China policy or China &apos;s role in the Security Council , and it does not take a balanced view on the Taiwan issue , the six @-@ party talks , EU @-@ China cooperation and global security issues .
I understand the need to use the agreement rejected by the Court as a basis , partly because the United States is demanding even more from Europe .
That is our main goal now .
Those people who have come to find such living conditions intolerable are in a trap , for the border with South Korea is still permanently closed off .
Without a decent road network it will be nearly impossible to consolidate security , encourage new economic activity and strengthen local governance .
The action is thus aimed both at acquiring the skills and at developing and subsequently updating those skills .
- Mr President , two @-@ thirds of the population of my country , Hungary , live in cities .
In its 2007 draft budget the Council is proposing to make substantial savings in administrative expenditure by doing away with Commission posts .
I am also from a new Member State , and I usually answer that instead of l@@ ament@@ ing that more young people go out than come back , we need to create conditions which build or offer a truly European perspective back home in Slovakia , in Lithuania or Latvia .
The next item is the joint debate on
I should like to make four comments .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for its explanations ; I believe that it has gra@@ sp@@ ed that we are worried about the situation with the Galileo programme − which is similar to what is happening in the case of Airbus , for example .
That is the true purpose of the debate .
The protection of fundamental rights is a priority .
We cannot leave the responsibility for dealing with this issue solely to the Spanish or Canary Islands authorities .
This plan must involve the countries from which these immigrants de@@ part , and must address the problems , especially economic problems of the immigrants &quot; countries of origin .
I am very glad that Commissioner Frattini addressed the subject of un@@ authorised workers , for it is sometimes the case that those elements in politics that get terri@@ bly worked up about immigration tolerate , at the same time , the presence in Europe of vast masses of illegal workers , con@@ stit@@ uting a sort of il@@ licit reserve of labour and also bringing down@@ ward pressure to bear on wages .
The most disgu@@ sting form of organised crime , human trafficking , is a European phenomenon , although we hardly talk about it .
The functioning of the single market and the mobility of Europeans within the Union makes it essential to define the conditions under which convic@@ tions in the Member States must be taken into account in the course of new legal proceedings involving different cases in another Member State .
It is urgent that we legisl@@ ate at European level on particular sectors , namely social services and health services of general interest , in order to provide them with legal certainty .
Another very important point that the Commission &apos;s action will address is the role of women and children .
We should also strive to ensure that India is better represented at the IMF .
Moreover , the issue of import tariffs must certainly be raised at bilateral level .
The precise responsibility for these attacks is still unclear , but there is strong suspicion of external involvement .
Nevertheless , the Commission is committed to addressing trade and social development , core labour standards and commitment to meaningful dialogue between the WTO and the International Labour Organization , both in the EU &apos;s own trade policy review and the trade policy reviews of other countries .
That is essential and that has been clearly stated in the report .
I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report , and I shall advise my group to vote in favour of the report as amended in the Agricultural Committee .
However , we must not del@@ ude ourselves or cultiv@@ ate major expectations , because the European Union does not have an integrated common strategy for Asia , with policies and mechanisms that will affect developments .
Mr President , I rise to speak on behalf of my colleague , E@@ ve@@ lin Lich@@ ten@@ berger , who is unable to attend this afternoon .
Firstly , it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Ant@@ oni Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez D@@ í@@ az , who was a Member of the European Parliament for many years , from 1987 to 1999 .
Mr President , Secretary @-@ General , High Representative of the Council ,
The Commission proposes a genuine internal market in energy , un@@ bund@@ ling networks as we did with tel@@ ec@@ oms , creating an ob@@ servatory to monitor stocks , developing a more sustainable energy mix , making energy savings .
A double majority would destroy the EU &apos;s culture of consensus , and the removal of the national Commissioners would make it difficult to get the EU to operate properly on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
Russia has always produced great figures who have sw@@ um against the tide of dictatorship and ris@@ ked their lives to ex@@ pose the crimes and ini@@ qui@@ ties of their governments .
The biggest challenge in the negotiations was how to respond to the changes that had occurred since 2004 in US legislation and the organisation of the administration while at the same time maintaining the principles relating to standards of data protection for Europeans .
I fear that Commissioner Mandelson &apos;s review of the EU &apos;s anti @-@ dumping rules comes a year too late .
In Portugal alone , jobs have been lost in the foot@@ wear factories of C &#91; amp &#93; J Cl@@ arks in A@@ rou@@ ca , Castel@@ o de Pa@@ i@@ va and Vila Nova de Ga@@ ia , of Ro@@ d@@ he in Tan@@ co@@ sc@@ o and of Ar@@ a in A@@ vin@@ tes .
The establishment of the Human Rights Agency is , to my mind , a definite step in the right direction .
There are some who ask and hope for assistance .
This is an initiative geared towards helping them , rather than hin@@ dering them .
One cannot fail to conclude that freedom of expression and freedom of opinion are being ever more frequently threatened and fl@@ ou@@ ted and are giving way to self @-@ cens@@ orship and intellectual terrorism .
Therefore , representatives of the Russian Government and democratic forces should be invited to discuss how the European Union can help today &apos;s Russia to avoid a per@@ va@@ sive pla@@ gue of xenophobia at our goodwill common legal environment conference .
On the basis of section 30@@ 1 of the Turkish Pen@@ al Code , the publisher , translator and publishing house are accused of causing public out@@ cry and inc@@ iting hatred against Tur@@ ks and of degra@@ ding democracy and the Turkish parliament .
the report by Mr Coelho on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council decision on the establishment , operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System ( SIS II ) - C6 @-@ 0@@ 30@@ 1 / 2005 - and
Parliament , the Council and the Commission have all taken a very proactive attitude in finding compromises on this very sensitive and complex dossier .
I very much regret the fact that we were unable , before this plenary session , to organise with our colleagues from the US Congress the video@@ conference that I proposed , that my fellow coordin@@ ators accepted and that would have enabled us , together with the US political authorities , to hold the necessary debate on the latter &apos;s ability to comply with this road map that you have made your own , Commissioner .
Today , with the reduction in the Structural Funds budgets , a form of un@@ bri@@ d@@ led competition has begun in the regions , and all of our colleagues are having a change of heart .
I should also like to thank Mrs Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez for her very positive approach and to assure both ladies and all the Members of Parliament that the Commission will work to facilitate this approach and to achieve fast agreement with the Council .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Bé@@ gu@@ in on her exceptionally positive report .
The proposal potentially concerns all citizens and economic operators in Europe .
One thing is completely clear , and that is that however bitter oppression may be in any particular case , however painful a dictatorship , it will not last forever .
Men need specialist services too .
But many Member States do not have technical screening facilities or trained nur@@ ses in place .
From the simpli@@ stic point of view of European integration , the proposed aims are understandable .
The LIFE + Programme and its predec@@ essors are the main funding instrument for the EU &apos;s environmental projects .
The EU should instead strive for targeted cooperation on significant and truly cross @-@ border issues .
For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the minimum consi@@ sted in rein@@ stating the preliminary draft budget for all the policies to which we are attached and , in particular , for the Lisbon objectives and the Gothenburg policies , not forgetting employment , solidarity , the environment and rural development .
For those two reasons alone , it ought to be as high as possible in terms of expenditure .
So much for the lo@@ f@@ ty goals and the bum@@ p@@ y return to earth .
As regards the Leonardo programme , the mobility of employees undertaking vocational training is of prime concern to the craft @-@ based industries and small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which also need to be made aware of mobility @-@ related issues .
The Round is suspended , something I deeply depl@@ ore and regret , but we are fighting hard to get it re@@ started .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the European Union has been referred to as the greatest example of conflict resolution in history .
The conci@@ li@@ atory message that the European Union has recently sent to the Russian Federation regarding stepping up relations on various levels is not , and must not be , separate from an invitation to dialogue and to implementing all possible measures to try to resolve the worst crisis of the post @-@ Soviet era without causing cas@@ u@@ alties .
Allow me to refer to the recent attacks on Catho@@ lics in Ti@@ bli@@ si .
In the EU , we must act to ensure that our legislation on toxic waste is such that we can guarantee to people in Africa that their countries will not be dumping grounds for our hazardous waste .
This dialogue could ultimately lead to the signing of the agreement , but that question is still premature and is not the purpose of the recommendation .
Dru@@ gs trafficking is linked to the general situation in Afghanistan , which could even be the topic of a separate question .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.@@ 05 p.m and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
They brief us extremely well after the event , outside the door , but we are never let in , not even as observers at the high @-@ level meetings .
I would ask those Members who have criticised our monetary policy , acc@@ using it of being too orthodo@@ x , simply to remember what the rates of interest for the medi@@ um@@ - and long @-@ term markets in their countries were before the introduction of the euro .
5 . Comm@@ em@@ oration of 1956 Hungarian U@@ pris@@ ing ( vote )
These derogations relate to the entry / exit schemes of the fleet capacity and the provision of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet .
The Schro@@ ed@@ ter report re@@ draws the balance between economic liberalisation and social protection .
A year on , and how have matters developed ?
This will make it possible to balance macroeconomic policy and to restore a proper policy mix .
Commissioner , I fully agree with you that there is a need , as you recently mentioned , to create a formal group , at European level , of transmission system operators that can make technical proposals on safety standards for the networks and other issues that are relevant to what we are dealing with .
We all want to strengthen rural areas .
Our allocation for 2007 to 2013 is only a quarter of what fairness would in principle require .
Parliament , as well as the Council , should be kept informed and consulted on issues such as the accession of new members and the appointment of the executive director .
( Applause )
Please , those of you from Scotland , do not be an@@ gry with me .
in writing . ( SV ) We are voting against this report , but we are absta@@ ining from voting on the Commission &apos;s proposal in this area .
A revision of the European Union Emis@@ sions Trading Sch@@ eme will provide greater stability for investments and accelerate the momentum to cut greenhouse gases .
We see this programme as a pu@@ zzle with many individual pieces , one that cannot really be put together in such a way as to produce a big picture .
Di@@ alogue between the various cultures needs to be established , and efforts made to integrate the different communities , without of course neglec@@ ting the minority communities within the EU .
I hope the Commission will note the estimate by its own Vice @-@ President , Gün@@ ter Verheugen , who says that the costs of excessive regulation in the single market amount to EUR 600 billion a year .
We need to find out openly and simply and in comparative format to what extent countries are fulfilling their promises - in other words , how much solidarity there is between us .
Reference has been made to the fact that Mr Barroso , at the beginning of this legislative period , set up a working party made up of Commissioners and t@@ asked with addressing the issue of basic freedoms .
The final matter I would like to raise are the internal affairs of Europe , which should be a better and safer place for all of our citizens to live .
In addition , I should like to appeal to the Commission to tackle the problem of the relationship between other areas of policy and development policy more effectively .
It means working with public documents .
The urban dimension is taken very seriously by the Commission .
This proposal was inspired by a call made unanimously by the Council on 12 April 2005 .
( EL ) Madam President , perhaps the overla@@ p between the competences of the national competition authorities and the competences of other regulatory authorities is leading to the fragmentation of competition policy in numerous Member States ?
With this report on multi@@ lingu@@ alism , Europe is implementing an &apos; anti @-@ Tower of Ba@@ bel &apos; project , insofar as it intends to promote and develop minority languages .
The Commission &apos;s role in the drafting process has also been crucial .
During the period 1997 @-@ 2002 approximately 96 % of new jobs were in service sectors .
It must be justi@@ fiable and proportionate and must not discrimin@@ ate against other operators .
We must ensure feedback .
The un@@ duly large number of excluded areas - for example , health - are , of course , still covered by the rules of the Treaty , something of which the Commissioner too is , fortunately , aware .
The European Union has called on Israel to cease its military action in Gaza .
This problem has to be addressed without delay .
Third - and this has been an issue that has had overwhelming support among the people around the region , although there are one or two who disagree - we want a separate budget line .
The measures proposed by the report in this regard are very courageous and interesting and they are very much in line with those being taken by the government of my country , Spain .
The report contains important measures for protecting victims and shows the extent of the protection measures that are needed .
One of the roots of the problem is the hop@@ eless situation in the countries of origin .
Some of the wording of the Schwa@@ b report appears to legitim@@ ise this House &apos;s Conference of Presidents &apos; attempts to hin@@ der the Ombudsman &apos;s work of monitoring European bodies , including OLAF .
These frank statements by Commissioner Wallström &apos;s spokes@@ man explicitly show that opponents of the Constitution did not , and still do not , have any opportunity to present their views .
It contains strong encouragement to move forward on the basis of ever @-@ closer cooperation between our two institutions .
We are in favour of the use of new technologies , provided they do not create a digital divide between those who have access to modern technology and those who do not .
The President of the European Parliament and the Members of the House made huge efforts to save Mr Mir@@ za @-@ Ta@@ hir Hus@@ sa@@ in &apos;s life .
Some comments made during the debate , indeed , were des@@ pic@@ able , such as the reference to an Israeli society &apos; hyp@@ noti@@ sed by ru@@ den@@ ess and racism &apos; , or the talk of Palestinian deaths counting less than Israeli deaths .
It is precisely because you have a deep @-@ rooted fear of the people that you prefer bra@@ in@@ washing to direct consultation of these citizens , whom you regard , deep down , as idi@@ ots .
Today , however , we are debating efforts by certain people who belong to the large European family to be able to regain exactly what we consider to be reasonable in our everyday lives .
The subsequent war of independence with Pakistan only served to exacerb@@ ate the extreme poverty , and not only in the provinces .
The successful football club is not the one that focuses on the trop@@ hy room : it is the one that focuses on the matches ahead .
( Applause )
This can be best done by defending workers &apos; rights , protecting public services and hal@@ ting the drive towards a militar@@ ised and fort@@ ressed European Union .
Our food health inspec@@ torate checked t@@ inned food originating from Russia in our country and in Germany , and found the same increase in these substances for which Russia had taken us to task .
It is not surprising that , coming out of this night@@ mare , Russian democracy is not yet perfect .
I would also like to welcome our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues , who have been Ob@@ servers so far , but they will be full Members of this House as of 1 January .
This is a fundamental issue within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy , since , if our objective is to be a dynamic and competitive knowledge @-@ based economy , research , technological development and innovation are undoubtedly the main tools for promoting growth , employment and competitiveness .
Unfortunately , I do not think the Council actually believes this and it is a pity that it did not support the Commission &apos;s request for EUR 70 billion .
That is why it is particularly worrying that the price of new , improved and second @-@ line AIDS medicines remains prohi@@ bi@@ tively high .
However , we and every member of the PSE working party in the Committee on Culture and Education agree on the subject &apos;s importance .
I mean here not only to the built environment and transport facilities , but also to access to work , medical care , social care , education , culture and sport for example .
There is no question that new technologies should break down many barriers for people with disabilities , provided that we achieve universal access to them and provided that technological advances take these people into account from the outset of their design stage .
Europe must adopt a proactive and leading position on global economic and social regulation .
This led to the out@@ la@@ wing of the Solidarity trade union .
It is therefore vital to develop a Community policy for the development of European society , encomp@@ assing both the demographic aspect and the immigration of qualified workers from outside the Union .
What I mean by this met@@ aph@@ or is that we should adopt the compromise that we have reached , because in that way we can have the regulation published by the end of the year and thus meet the deadline for starting the process to implement REACH by 1 June 2007 .
A compromise remains , of course , a compromise and nothing more .
What , though , do we have here in black and white ?
On the other hand , we find it inappropriate to prevent the collection of fees where attendance of customs staff is requested beyond the normal office hours .
The Commission can accept Amendments 7 , 8 and 10 .
His state of health is extremely serious : he has lost 40 ki@@ los , and his life is in danger .
The current leader of Belarus would never win genuine free elections .
The vote on the Elles and Gre@@ ch reports will take place on Thursday .
The North Sea Regional Ad@@ visory Council is of the same opinion and therefore I shall not be proposing that it starts in 2007 .
Moreover , they play an important part in the data and information base for future actions , for example for time @-@ sharing .
Money from the ESF is also being used to fund older workers through re@@ training , the completion of their education , and their integration .
Amon@@ gst other things , the need to identify and te@@ ar down barriers to equal pay could be highlighted .
First of all , I am not very happy about the procedure .
the report by El@@ mar Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the Commission &apos;s Communication on the En@@ lar@@ gement Strategy and Main Challen@@ ges 2006 @-@ 2007 , and
We need the institutions in order for the European Union to function democratically and effectively , and we need a budget that is comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate with the EU &apos;s ambitions ; I should , however , also like to say something about what is ter@@ med &apos; capacity to act &apos; , which is , as I see it , of crucial importance .
This is not so much intended for the new countries as it is for us .
By maintaining the sub@@ stitution principle , albeit via the submission of a plan , we can guarantee that , in the reasonably near future , we will have a world , or at least a Europe , with fewer dangerous chemicals .
We would , however , have liked to have seen the matter discussed further in order to have achieved a stronger form of words .
The delegation of the Austrian People &apos;s Party , however , with its knowledge of the structure and size of Austrian businesses , has demanded an amendment to the effect that the Fund would become active as soon as 500 - rather than 1 000 - workers were laid off , and should give out a comm@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate amount in funds .

to give banana @-@ producing Member States control over the granting of aid , so that this can be done as effectively as possible , taking account of the specific priorities of these regions .
Full membership cannot be the only goal ; alternative perspectives for cooperation with the countries in our neighbourhood must be developed , and this is something to which the Heads of Government should give some thought , not least with reference to Turkey , particularly considering the possibility of a privileged partnership .
The Commission , assisting the Presidency in the negotiation of future PNR agreements with third countries , will ensure that security issues are properly addressed through the transfer and appropriate use of PNR data , while protecting personal data as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Charter .
Because the destruction of tropical forests has major significance for overall emissions , the developing countries have or may have a key role in allevi@@ ating climate change , so that emissions caused by de@@ fore@@ station can be cut and sustainable forestry boo@@ sted .
It is difficult because regulation of the Internet is very much in its early days , but we must not sh@@ y away from it .
This document is an important contribution to the Commission &apos;s work on the strategic energy review .
Before we can ever talk about common energy policy , considerable improvements need to be made in the areas of compliance and implementation .
I urge the Commission to keep up the pressure on the Member States to take more resol@@ ute measures to enhance the competitive environment , eliminate administrative barriers and thus facilitate the opening up of energy markets .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will be brief .
One or two specific questions were asked , one of which related to Russian agricultural trade .
If I look at the activities of the European Parliament , and the regulations , directives and recommendations we have adopted for Member States and their citizens , I can say that we have been working well , doing an effective job to the benefit of our voters .

I would like to make a few brief comments , Mr President .
It is very good to see you in the Chair .
This quickly leads us on to the issue of implementing foreign law .
Could you also provide us with more information on the work of the high @-@ level working group on the sharing and protection of data ?
As far as the protection of fundamental rights , personal data and privacy are concerned , they will try to persuade our &apos; American friends &apos; to respect them , obviously just as they respect them in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Unfortunately , this has resulted in more people being involved in road accidents .
Whenever I take the floor in this House , and the opportunity arises , I stress that the fundamental duty of every parliament and every institution with legislative power is to create simple legislation that is readily understandable and serves the citizens &apos; interests .
The next item is the report by N@@ ir@@ j Dev@@ a , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on EU relations with the Pacific Islands A strategy for a strengthened partnership .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , many thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work .
The growth of small businesses is crucial for the competitiveness of the European economy .
O@@ be@@ sity is the most common form of mal@@ nutrition and arises from an excessive storage of fat .
If we are to take this legislative report on Thursday afternoon , it would probably not be advisable to vote on it at the same time , and hence my request that the debate be scheduled either on Thursday morning or on Wednesday evening , since there are windows left on both days .
That is , in principle , the case , but the President does of course regard the consent of the majority in this House as important , especially when dealing with such thor@@ ny issues , and that is why the Conference of Presidents ended up , in agreement with him , deciding as it has done .
You will be aware of whom I am talking ; I am talking about an ethnic group that , in 2004 , and by an overwhelming majority , said &apos; yes &apos; to the European Union and sought re@@ union with the other ethnic group in their homeland , and whose isolation we then promised to end .
If one considers how things work in practice and the attitudes of the broad majority of the population , it is at once clear that most of these improvements have been accomplished only on paper .
We live in the continent of the three great cultures and religions - the Christian , the Jewish and the Islamic , and we have fellow citizens who come from one of the world &apos;s other great cultures and who are adher@@ ents of the world &apos;s other religions .
While respecting the autonomy of each institution , we need to stress the comm@@ on@@ ality of our European principles .
in writing .
I do , however , think that it would be a good idea for Parliament to take decisions on some of the proposal &apos;s main conclusions , and this should certainly include g@@ rub@@ bing @-@ up .
In carrying out parliamentary supervision , we must ensure greater professionalism and political responsibility , especially when monitoring the law@@ fulness of the methods used in counter @-@ terrorism measures .
We have heard much talk of human rights , as if fighting terrorism and a belief in human rights were incompatible .
This provision also applies in areas of codecision , so in my view the procedures set up by the EC Treaty have been fully respected , both on read@@ mission and on visa facilit@@ ation .
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
We also know that because of the exagger@@ ated , h@@ yst@@ er@@ ical and un@@ true statements of the media , the situation gave rise to fundamental fears in Western European countries .
I have heard plenty on the issue of ageing , disability , race and religion .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I propose that after Amendment 19 we insert the text of this oral amendment , which I believe also has the agreement of the rapporteur : &apos; in view of the recent discover@@ ies of extremely dangerous terrorist organisations in Italy and France &apos; .
How these are achieved should be left up to the individual Member States .
Member of the Commission .
The next item is the report by Mr Ho@@ witt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on corporate social responsibility : a new partnership .
Despite repeated warnings from the international community , Iran continues its efforts in the area of uranium enrich@@ ment .
However , we are not all equal where this success is concerned .
Indeed , it would seem that this regulation is placing a disproportionate amount of responsibility on the Member States located at the Union &apos;s external borders .
I would like to highlight the outstanding significance of the &apos; Clean Sky &apos; joint technology initiative in this respect , which will make it possible for the European aerospace industry to take up the challenge thrown down to it by the debate on climate change .
In principle , we very much welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals , but my problem is that they risk becoming the em@@ peror &apos;s clothes .
F@@ acts like these only begin to illustrate how far matters of location alone can place islands at a competitive disadvantage .
Hence , I would ask the Commissioner and also the Commission to consider how best to trans@@ pose the policies to be adopted in future in the areas of development and regional policy .
I therefore ask the House to allow a roll @-@ call vote on amendment 12 , even though we did not request it in time .
Speci@@ fically , we must as@@ certain precisely what their characteristics and needs are .
A full and objective evaluation of all aspects of this issue will enable us to take the right decisions .
We are also aware of the concerns raised by a number of Members of the European Parliament concerning the treatment of the Mar@@ i @-@ El , notably with regard to the Mar@@ i language in school teaching and the harassment of journalists and the presidential elections in December 2004 .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say straight away to Mr Watson and Mr Dau@@ l , and to others , that there is a perfectly simple way to have more women : co @-@ presidency .
These two men were fron@@ tier@@ s@@ men , and it is fron@@ tier@@ s@@ men such as they who are the makers of Europe , for frontiers are the sc@@ ab@@ s that form over the wo@@ unds of history , and we are here in order that those wo@@ unds may never be re@@ opened .
It would therefore be a mistake to under@@ value or , worse still , to forget the values emphasised in the Berlin Declaration : democracy , peace , freedom , justice and , above all , the importance of the individual and human dignity .
More effective and better supervision and cooperation among super@@ vis@@ ors is a matter of necessity , but , nevertheless , if we want the ultimate result to be success , we do think that , at this stage of the development and profound transformation of financial markets , the opening of an interinstitutional debate on this subject is , without doubt , the best way of making head@@ way .
The Council is working together with the Commission on all the aspects specified , and we also welcome the strong interest of the European Parliament , which is also demonstrated by this debate .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , it is good that Mrs Ber@@ ès &apos; question on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is being discussed and answered here today .
We started discussing the van den Burg report in committee this week , and one of the key topics also in the post @-@ F@@ SAP agenda is how to develop a good supervisory system for Europe .
With the submission of President Ah@@ ti@@ sa@@ ari &apos;s proposal to the UN Security Council , the process now enters its decisive phase .
Therefore I would like to ask colleagues to support amendments 166 / 16@@ 7 , 170 / 17@@ 1 , 175 and 19@@ 4 , and to oppose the inclusion of any genetic contamination threshold , which means to oppose the AG@@ RI Committee &apos;s amendment 41 and any others with this effect .
As the Commissioner already mentioned , sport , and certainly professional sport , not least the economic aspects of professional football -@@ which is what this report is about - is affected by European legislation in all kinds of ways .
It would be un@@ think@@ able to have football games without spect@@ ators : in some cases extreme measures have been taken which , in my view , have damaged the spect@@ ator nature of the sport .
If soccer is not to become a tool of law@@ lessness and violence , we must change the environment in which it operates - in terms of business and the media - radically and rapidly .
I fully support the PSE Group &apos;s position and call on all Members - and indeed I would particularly call on all my Irish colleagues - to support this regulation .
( EL ) Mr President , this regulation is needed and it is needed quickly , because medicine has advanced , progress is being made and there are also high hopes of innovative therap@@ ies .
That which is in this proposal for legislation goes well beyond what we did earlier , for the Commission has already en@@ acted its own regulation allowing small and medium @-@ sized businesses going through the approval process a reduction in costs of up to 90 % , and here too , or so I believe , everything that could be done has been .
At some point , sooner rather than later , the European Commission - despite its General Committee on Budgets - will stretch itself too far and all of this wonderful financial engineering involving &apos; back @-@ loading &apos; and &apos; front @-@ loading &apos; will not be sufficient to deal with so many priorities .
The share of potato star@@ ch in total production has decreased from 25 % to 20 % over the last three years .
I think that the Member States that have generated this short@@ fall want to benefit from the carry @-@ over .
Everyone is absolutely clear that we do not want US @-@ style class actions , so now is our unique opportunity to design something European which respects European values of our society and justice .
If , though , I may start with the Council , what is ter@@ med a gentlemen &apos;s agreement has been in place in respect of certain budget matters since 1970 , but , since that time , the European Community has developed to an enormous degree .
I have focused on the agencies &apos; general functioning and I should like to devote the majority of my speech today to this issue .
Therefore , in my report I urged the responsible bodies in those two Member States to start reporting data .
We still have to discuss the same measures to be taken , measures that should now be standard and routine in the European Union .
It has to be done in a very balanced way : on the one hand , we have to educ@@ ate people , especially young people , that this is a dangerous illness .
30 . D@@ isch@@ arge 2005 : Section III , Commission ( vote )
33 . D@@ isch@@ arge 2005 : Section VII , Committee of the Regions ( vote )
Some progress has been made by including in the agreement on the 2007 @-@ 2013 financial perspectives a commitment that a certification of expenditure by Member States will be required in future .
This delay is all the more regrettable when one reali@@ ses , as I am doing today , that Mr Costa &apos;s draft report completely vali@@ dates the necessity for this initiative , and we agree , Mr Costa , with most of the actual operational suggestions .
I think first of all that we must try to avoid distortions of competition .
One issue Europe must deal with urgently is the US request to establish Theatre Mis@@ si@@ le Defence facilities on our eastern border .
We would like to see more action .
My question is , are sanctions in fact being considered ?
We have repeatedly called on the war@@ ring parties to observe the 2002 ar@@ mis@@ tice agreement and to respect human rights .
Secondly , a uniform budget and tax policy is an attempt to stra@@ it @-@ jacket the finances of the new Member States , ignoring their specific development needs , and thereby preventing them from eliminating any development gaps .
The Commission awaits with interest Parliament &apos;s resolution on the issue , which will play an important role regarding the Commission &apos;s next steps .
At the same time , this directive will contribute to the simplification and clarification of the work of the Commission .
However , we understand that the health of the economies of those countries which have opted to join the EMU is important to that of the UK and we support all measures which seek to ensure the economic stability of our major trading partners .
Russia now finds itself in the same position as Saudi Arabia or Iran .
We call on the State authorities to ratify the UN Convention on ab@@ duction by force and to en@@ act the implementing provisions .
I declare resumed the session suspended on Thursday 26 April 2007 .
( Parliament adopted the motion . )
The point is to support a process that must bring Arab countries closer to the values of our democracies , without pre@@ tending and without acc@@ using them of not sharing these values from the beginning of the process .
In politics , sub@@ t@@ le@@ ty is rare , but I am suggesting it all the same .
What we have is a clear case of un@@ due pressure by a large country against a small one .
( SK ) The purpose of my presentation is to warn European consumers who wear Chinese textile products .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , thank you very much to Mr K@@ ac@@ z@@ ma@@ re@@ k and to the Commissioner for his response to the report .
If this is not allowed , then it tells us that the Treaty is not working , and that is why it needs review and attention .
Un@@ acceptable though it is to treat nuclear weapons so care@@ lessly , that is no reason for allowing ourselves to state something that has proved to be un@@ true .
I should like to thank Mrs Wallis and the committee for the very responsible work they have done on this matter .
Yet the services that support and gra@@ vit@@ ate around health care are almost exclusively profit @-@ oriented sectors , and indeed they need their profits to sustain further research and development and innovation .
Last year Parliament succ@@ um@@ bed to false arguments and , under pressure from the left , the unions and some governments , removed healthcare from the services directive .
My comments are confined to their application .
As for the fourth point , Commissioner , I believe that we need to discuss it seriously : it concerns the structural policy and the Lisbon Strategy .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , the Committee on Regional Development has recently tabled a couple of important own @-@ initiative reports .
I am pleased that much of what we called for in this report was reflected in the Commission &apos;s communication published in April , and , perhaps nai@@ vely , I like to believe that was part of the intense interaction between the Commission &apos;s D@@ Gs and the European Parliament .
That concludes the vote .
It would be a serious error to ren@@ ounce our identity , our Ju@@ da@@ eo @-@ Christian roots and a social model based on a family composed of father , mother and children .
Mr Abu Am@@ r mentioned that his government considers itself the cabinet of President Abbas .
Israel should stop targeting missi@@ les at its enemies and free all the elected representatives of the Palestinians ;
The answer to the question as to whether we should finance authorities that do not want peace is obvious , or so it would seem .
The Commission fully shares the Hon@@ ourable Member &apos;s concern about de@@ fore@@ station and pe@@ at land dra@@ ining in South @-@ East Asia . It is aware of the link with the fast @-@ growing demand for palm oil .
Therefore , there is no report by Parliament on this proposal , and the Commission and the Council can persist in maintaining the status quo and per@@ severe in their state of dead@@ lock .
By means of this vote , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats broke an earlier compromise with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that protected health services by keeping them outside the scope of the &apos; Services &apos; Directive .
Together , we must fight the degra@@ ding spread of illegal migration , which is why we need a strong and decisive European Union , a Union that enjoys the trust of those who live in it .
The drafting of a new Treaty is in the interests of all of us .
( PL ) Mr Prime Minister , Mr President .
Let me tell you that those who deny the validity , 50 years on from the signing of the Treaties of Rome , of the univers@@ ally recognised and familiar symbols of the EU are - symbo@@ lic@@ ally , adding gr@@ ist to the mills of those who , questioning European integration as such , wish to turn their backs on it and return to their own identities as nation states .
I also wish to thank those Members who helped ste@@ er this difficult and very controversial report clearly in the direction of a compromise , and thus helped us all make considerable progress .
The areas where they apply often form part of Europe &apos;s Natura 2000 network , which network of protected nature conservation sites located in the Member States is at the heart of the EU &apos;s environmental policy and of the preservation and recovery of biodiversity .
There are no contradictions .
Histor@@ ically , this has , for us , been an important connection with European countries , and it must be developed so that it becomes quick and safe .
- Before the vote :
A transparent appointment procedure with public hearings for candidates is very much what is called for .
Written Stat@@ ements ( Rule 116 ) : see Minutes
However , the degree of frustration on either side , be it Palestinian or Israeli , is just as great as our endeavours to further the peace process .
One is that the Arab League Initiative is something that was missing at the time of Camp David .
We must draw our own conclusions from this .
Therefore , the fact that Malta has to shoulder the blame for incidents that take place in Liby@@ an waters is un@@ just and unfair .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , illegal immigration should be addressed as a matter of urgency , because that is what it has been for a while .
After all , we are talking about an EU Member State , which means that we as a Union are responsible .
For this reason Malta is entitled to the solidarity of the European Union .
The exchange of a wealth of information contained in personal data has proved similarly controversial .
Last week , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur .
The principle of not in@@ tru@@ ding on the territory of another institution remains intact , and I am not very sure how this process can be organised .
We consider that some activities were carried out in a way which infring@@ es EU public procurement legislation .
Member States rely upon the derogation from the Treaty under Article 2@@ 96 .
Let us stand against a water@@ ed down regulation which will not provide the level of protection of public health and the environment wanted by the citizens .
- Hans @-@ Peter Martin report
I want to be quite emph@@ atic about that , because I still recall certain discussions .
I also assume the honourable Member is aware that , in accordance with Annex I to this Decision , a North European gas pipeline is categor@@ ised under &apos; projects of European interest &apos; : the category of projects given the highest priority .
These talks will also certainly involve Kosovo .
This is why more and better instruments are needed to address it , including at European level , should this prove necessary .
If this report can move us towards a better common asylum system , then it is worthy of support in this House , and we in the Socialist Group will be supporting this report fully .
Ju@@ dging by the lat@@ eness of the hour , the politicians working on home @-@ affairs policy are the hard @-@ working ones : we are still at work .
In addition to decisions on climate protection , further agreements of long @-@ term importance were also reached at these summits : with the US and Canada we agreed to strengthen regulatory cooperation ; with Russia we agreed to establish an early @-@ warning system for energy crises and to open a dialogue on investment ; with Japan we agreed to enforce the protection of intellectual property rights more effectively .
I hope that in future concrete steps will be taken to demonstrate that the Food Safety Authority really is independent .
The main reason for this request was that everything that is in the draft Directive can be regulated more effectively on a smaller scale , in other words by the Member States or their regions .
It is clear that , if two English people have a road accident in France , they are going to apply France &apos;s traffic laws - they would not be able to see someone driving on the left as being in the right .
Some of the problems that emerged during the course of this public consultation had already been the subject of European Parliament negotiations and resolutions .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to welcome the work that has been done , not only by the rapporteur but , I believe , by all the groups as a whole .
The current report supports the lifting of the ban on the use of fish oil and fl@@ our in ru@@ min@@ ant fo@@ d@@ der .
It is not the go @-@ ahead for social dumping .
Madam President , I am disappointed that Commissioner Š@@ pi@@ dla has told us today that he does not propose a new communication on this issue .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , for many years , everyone has been saying that , in relation to the transport of goods in all European countries , rail is losing the battle .
Everything people want to achieve these days using multi @-@ modal systems was already in place then .
Therefore , it would be good to find a logical compromise between social concerns and safety , and simultaneously improve the performance of airlines .
I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Mandelson and his services , who have dramatically improved the flow of information sent to our committee regarding the various bilateral and inter@@ regional trade negotiations .
As far as foot@@ wear of Chinese origin is concerned , the Commission is called on to monitor imports closely , in order to prevent the risk of China &apos;s circum@@ vent@@ ing the already inadequate trade defence measures adopted by the Union .
It is also in China &apos;s own interest to do so , though - you know that the Chinese company Hei@@ er will soon have an interest in protecting its own patents .
It is therefore a source of pride for me to say that it was Portugal that suggested , and it was also a Portuguese company that designed SIS @-@ ON@@ E@@ 4@@ ALL , the technological solution whereby the new Member States could become full members of the Schengen area and whereby borders with those countries are to disappear at the end of the Portuguese Presidency .
After the reve@@ aling comments by Germany &apos;s Interior Minister , Mr Schä@@ uble , my group will be on the guard against the erosion of civil liberties that under@@ pin our society .
As regards the Agenda for Innovation , the Prime Minister has just now taken the opportunity to lend his clear and unequi@@ vocal support to the creation of a European Institute of Technology , to the launch of the first Knowledge and Innovation Community , innovation precisely targeted at the issue of climate change , and anything we can do to give fresh impetus to the Agenda for Innovation .
Madam President , please allow me to make a technical remark .
We are in the European Parliament and we are being called upon to give immediate replies to a extremely urgent and complicated issue .
It is also in Kosovo and Albania &apos;s interest to tie Serbia into the new status as tigh@@ tly as possible and to send Serbia a clear signal from Europe .
I have on several occasions , notably in my joint letter with my colleague , Louis Michel , to the chair of the Development Committee of 26 March , reiter@@ ated our commitment to carefully examining the committee &apos;s observations on the strategy papers in the preparation of the annual action programmes and in the implementation of our projects and programmes .
Another question I would like to raise is that of development level inde@@ xes for countries or regions : is the per capita GDP enough , what weigh@@ ting should be given to unemployment levels , how can quality of life in a particular area be measured , etc .
This also requires a functioning system of cross @-@ border cooperation .
Too much concentration in central , urban regions does not do much to further the cause of peripheral regions .
It cannot be that we in Europe promote basic democratic rights all over the world through the European institutions , while in Brussels , in the heart of the European Union , these same basic rights are being tro@@ dden under@@ foot .
That is how to put prevention before law enforcement .
The responsibility for regulating well is hence a shared one .
On behalf of the entire Commission , I truly can promise you that in all the instruments that we are applying , we completely respect the rights of Parliament and will keep Parliament fully informed in the interests of mutual respect between our institutions .
I myself would like to comment on paragraph 40 first , which stresses the responsibility of the Member States .
I also fully support the desire to establish methods of consultation with the European Parliament on the adoption of so @-@ called non @-@ binding legal acts , especially since these acts are fairly common : they often earn attributes such as &apos; unclear &apos; and &apos; in@@ efficient &apos; , and their excessive use may be a manifest@@ ation of exceeding the scope of the Commission &apos;s .
However , this last comment is a technical one and does not de@@ tract from the report as a whole .
I should like to express my thanks to the President of the European Parliament for his kind words and my deep appreciation for the invitation to be here today .
These measures - and here I am speaking as someone who lives in a country of transit - may also lead to a shift towards the railways .
Subject : Promotion of independent living for persons with disabilities
( NL ) Mr President , this late in the day , when only our do@@ gged spokes@@ men on agriculture and the agriculture Commissioner are still with us - for which my thanks , Commissioner - milk may not be the most obvious refresh@@ ment we are thir@@ sty for , especially after the previous debate .
( PL ) Mr President , the common organisation of the market for milk and milk products is an important issue both for individual Member States and for the entire European Union .
Of course , there are some explanations for the increase in these prices , and I would like to come back to this a little later , but first I shall just put things into a more general perspective .
I believe these are organisations that should be better equipped to deal with such tasks .
It then continues in juven@@ ile gangs and , following this radic@@ alisation , may then culmin@@ ate in attacks .
Time and again we hear the Council , and to a lesser degree the Commission , talking about fundamental rights , human rights and democracy , but this rings somewhat hol@@ low when we learn that state control of citizens is growing fast .
( PT ) ( in@@ audi@@ ble ) ... the Council &apos;s reluct@@ ance to give Europol , Eurojust , the Co@@ unter @-@ Terror@@ ism Coordin@@ ator and the Sit@@ C@@ en any institutional , legal or financial muscle , which could transform ad hoc links into a genuine strategic cooperation against terrorism .
Madam President , I have just come from a press conference calling for rigorous implementation of economic sanctions against the Iranian regime , a not@@ orious sponsor of terrorism across the Middle East and beyond .
Member States will retain the right to regulate or even prohibit the transport of certain dangerous goods within their territory , for example , for reasons of national security or of environmental protection .
Did they stop and consider the viability of the underlying assets , the fraud risks , the track records of the origin@@ ators and the trends in the markets ?
We think any suggestions , means and proposals that might be of real help in achieving the final and fundamental objective of stability and progress in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina must be taken into account .
It is with that objective and that intention that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to conduct the second EU @-@ Africa Summit in Lisbon in December .
He was tried in camera and sentenced to 18 years in prison , 11 of which were to be spent in soli@@ t@@ ary con@@ fin@@ ement .
( FR ) Madam President , I would first like to congratulate Mrs Valen@@ ciano on this report , which combines courage and ambition and I support her in all her proposals .
The fishermen hope that the wording of the regulation has arisen out of ignor@@ ance on the part of the European Commission with regard to the true scale of fishing in the Baltic Sea by individual countries .
I look forward to working with you to fulfil our common goals and to achieve a citizens &apos; internal market .
I also want to thank the Commissioner for her energe@@ tic promotion of consumer protection and the profile she is giving to this .
Only strong and urgent international action can stop Darfur from being the first of many more similar conflicts , whose underlying cause is deser@@ ti@@ fication .
Isolation will only make the population pay a greater price .
Certainly , Western aid donors are watching Bangladesh very carefully , given the concerns about the deterior@@ ating human rights situation over the last few years and also increasing Islam@@ ist radic@@ alisation of its society and a departure , very sadly , from its original course of secular multi @-@ party democracy - a model we in the EU should strongly continue to support for that country .
Mr President , did you take my oral amendment to add the name of the third former prime minister , Mr Mou@@ du@@ d Ah@@ med , to the original text ?
He held discussions with them , inter@@ viewed them , campaign@@ ed for the release of those of them who were imprisoned and in general fought for the freedom of nations and for justice .
Now economic poverty , information poverty and energy poverty are all hit@@ ting the same people .
What specific policy measures does the Commission envis@@ age to eliminate these un@@ desirable effects ?
The approach taken by the European Commission when al@@ locating CO2 emissions quotas was , at the very least , strange .
This training is expensive , after all , and we must not create a system whereby some rail companies are free@@ whe@@ eling and systematically avoiding paying their fair share of training costs by recru@@ iting newly trained staff from other companies .
( Applause )
We think that in principle , the Commission &apos;s proposal is positive , as to a certain extent it gives farmers the opportunity to take the initiative to ren@@ ounce .
It might have been cheap , but it was not good !
These recall campaigns ( it is not just Mat@@ tel , there have also been others in recent months ) have shown that there is a very great need for action in the European Union to guarantee that product safety is at the highest possible level .
The Member States should be forced to make appropriate resources available - this is included in our proposal .
I was up in my room because I had a problem , but I listened to it in the original , in your marvellous language .
In supporting the Commission &apos;s actions in this sphere , I would like to ask the Commissioner , although perhaps this question is a bit premature , but nevertheless , how are we to understand the arrangement whereby the Commission will implement the principle of partnership in this matter , in other words , what are the possible instruments of partnership ?
However , many Greek environmental bodies and mon@@ ast@@ eries located on bur@@ ned land possess the know @-@ how and the scientists necessary to organise the rapid re@@ aff@@ ore@@ station of these areas by extensive plan@@ ting operations .
The question of intellectual property then needs to be dealt with in such a way that it also becomes attractive for a medium @-@ sized enterprise to participate in the E@@ IT .
Invest@@ ments are required all the way through , from production to dissemination and use of the research and innovation results .
It has been believed that the internal market liberalization will turn the EU into an important actor on the international energy scene , but it has been found that , in fact , the Union lacks an external and homo@@ genous energy policy dimension .
( PL ) Mr President , we have today voted on and adopted Mr Du@@ ff &apos;s report on the exercise of the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament for citizens of the Union resi@@ ding in a Member State of which they are not nationals .
in writing . - ( DE ) The fact that around 18.@@ 5 million third @-@ country nationals are living in the EU clearly demonstrates that Europe needs a common immigration policy .
This difficult decision is to be taken in November .
The European Union considers that it is time to assess the steps to be taken post @-@ 2012 and to establish a global approach involving the participation of a large number of countries .
This will enable consumers to make better and more informed choices .
I also request , in order to make education more efficient , ensuring the training and motivation of teachers .
At the last Strasbourg meeting of the Conference of Presidents , the President sol@@ em@@ n@@ ly promised that all the political groups would have access to all the IGC documents .
The citizens support a credible common foreign and security policy .
No@@ where is safe from a no vote .
Many other organisations maintained their cooperation with Palestine , particularly a large number of European local authorities .
On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislation &apos;s function and where it can be improved , both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive .
It is in the compromise that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment : we will say no to the mutual obligatory approval of pesticides , but yes to the mutual obligatory approval of data .
Such changes made to the report unfortunately show very clearly whose interests are in fact close to the heart of the majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and especially those of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , because it is very obvious who profits from the prevailing tax regimes in the EU .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
Not only this will jeopardi@@ se prosperity ; it will also deep@@ en the democratic deficit of the EU as a whole .
I am sorry , really sorry that a report like this should reach plenary .
Finally , I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to Mr Vir@@ ran@@ ko@@ ski .
The European Parliament does not contain 100 people capable of understanding the European budget by activity , with the consequence that this entails : the economic le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy of the European Union .
The Commission has , of course , carefully examined all reactions to the Green Paper , of which there are many hundreds .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , I would have been happy to share my time with the Commissioner , because I am interested to hear her views on GMOs , but I will be here for the entire debate .
I understand where Mr Baringdorf is coming from when he says that this is a fundamental problem , but I do not think that the increases we are seeing at this time are to the advantage of producers .
The initiative in the Green Paper and the excellent report by Mr Florenz have without doubt shown us the way .
Re@@ ally , in a glob@@ alised world , Europe and the various EU countries will be defined by the qualifications of their human resources .
I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for listening and being available to everyone .
In the interests of ending the se@@ gregation that exists in education , I support the initi@@ ation of measures to provide information and engage in social dialogue .
in writing . - ( FR ) The Corbett report recommends that , in order to save about EUR 10 million a year , we should no longer have the verb@@ ati@@ m reports of proceedings in this Parliament translated into all the official languages .
A more glob@@ alised economy implies a readiness for change which means greater mobility .
Madam President , I have two points to make , the first on the procedure , the second on the voting list .
The report also stresses the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States .
This is why the EU cannot afford to wai@@ ve its condi@@ tionality at this crucial jun@@ cture .
dem@@ ilit@@ ar@@ isation of international relations and a gradual reduction in arm@@ aments and military expenditure ;
These conclusions are available on the Council &apos;s website and are the tangible result of over a year &apos;s preparation .
( NL ) Mr President , I would like to thank the Minister for his reply .
What we are asking of you , of the Council and of the Commission , is to conduct an experiment , to run some pilot projects converting part of the crop currently used to produce hero@@ in to produce pa@@ ink@@ ill@@ ers instead .
I am about to end , Mr President .
At its meeting this morning - Thursday , 25 October - the Conference of Presidents unanimously chose the winner of the Sakharov Prize .
( Applause )
- Est@@ eves report
Communication of Council common positions : see Minutes
The missing names are those of Dan@@ uta Ter@@ esa Sz@@ pil@@ a and Al@@ ina Maria Br@@ y@@ k .
It is a document that is largely based on a consensus , which is unexpected in an environmental policy that it could be said is going to generate a new European policy and is opening up a new path .
May I remind you of the thought to be found in the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , that one condition for effective soil protection is the maintenance and development of agriculture .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( L@@ V ) Thank you , Mr President .
It doesn &apos;t matter which of the emit@@ ting areas we investigate , there will always be &apos; voices &apos; that want to protect the very industry we are talking about now .
The Commission &apos;s essential work of implementing Community law , of exec@@ uting programmes , and of negotiating international agreements , will continue and is made more visible in other parts of the Programme &apos;s text .
We need the active involvement of leaders at all levels - national and regional .
President of the French Republic . - ( FR ) Mr President of the European Parliament , Hon@@ ourable Members , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I thank you for inviting me to speak to you , in this building where the democratic heart of Europe be@@ ats .
The aim is to ensure an approach which is more in line with the different situations in the fisheries sector which require a range of strategies to combat a common problem .
It can also be a consequence of industry , tourism , and urban development .
All of this was accompanied by close and unprecedented li@@ aison between experts and politicians , the ministers in this area who perio@@ dically met in special meetings to direct the process with the total solidarity of the Commission .
In other words , it will be , in my view , an initial basis for a comprehensive strategic approach and discussion .
We know that in some countries there are going to be disasters , even if we do not know when exactly : the floods in South @-@ East Asia are one example .
The second point is of course the definition of humanitarian aid and its principles , which were reiter@@ ated by the Commissioner : humanity , neutrali@@ ty , im@@ parti@@ ality , independence .
So that is why I believe all those areas taken together can create a virtu@@ ous circle helping all our goals at once .
To achieve this , however , the world trade negotiations must be brought to an end , subsidies to European farmers must be lo@@ wered and US customs fees must be reduced .
This used to be the rhetoric in the days of deep@@ est Commun@@ ism when financial capitali@@ sts were labelled &apos; Wall Street thu@@ gs &apos; .
The re@@ draft offers greater flexibility in the application of the criteria en@@ um@@ er@@ ated in Annex II . In general , however , there are still many provisions that make this directive an elaborate bureaucratic and expensive instrument .
These politicians would , of course , need to be hand@@ som@@ ely rewarded for their efforts .
Which measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that illegal immigrants , particularly women and children , enjoy decent temporary living conditions , so that Member States uni@@ form@@ ly respect their international commitments ?
Exp@@ anding trade is a common interest for Europe and Ukraine , but there is a need for un@@ distorted trade that also ensures the application by Ukraine of the social , employment , animal health , plant health and environmental rules .
The accession of the new Member States , including Slovakia , to the Schengen area , says clearly to the people of Europe that the Iron Cur@@ tain , built by the totalitarian Communist regimes between Western and Eastern Europe , will be con@@ signed to the history books after 21 December 2007 .
We must respond to the fact that Ukraine is going to join the World Trade Organisation .
Member States are proposing various forms of protection from poverty and social exclusion .
It is important that we protect all religious communities from persecution .
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Mr President , the Commission &apos;s communication on fle@@ x@@ ic@@ urity has triggered an important and useful discussion throughout the Union .
To create a genuine European rail space , we must either harmonise Technical Speci@@ fications of Interoper@@ ability or introduce mutual recognition of standards .
This vision is a burden to the UK because many of the EU population buy only one @-@ way tickets .
Protection of minors is guaranteed , as is the protection of EU citizens from inc@@ itement to all discrimination . These new services shall contribute to the financing of films and the European audiovisual component .
Those guidelines should take into account the demands of families with children .
The European Parliament has put on the agenda a Commission statement on the constitutional reform planned for 2 December in the Boli@@ vari@@ an Republic of Venezuela when what should be on the agenda is a debate on the current attempt to deny all the people of the EU Member States the right to be consulted , by way of a referendum , on the so @-@ called &apos; constitutional &apos; , &apos; mini &apos; , &apos; simplified &apos; , &apos; reform &apos; or now &apos; Lisbon &apos; Treaty .
None of these three requirements are in fact met .
You therefore have the support of this Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control , Commissioner K@@ allas , for the structural @-@ fund guidelines .
Furthermore , we reject the term &apos; fle@@ x@@ ic@@ urity &apos; as a meaning@@ less piece of word @-@ ju@@ ggling .
If President Putin did not order the de@@ ed , he certainly knows who did .
As regards the PM@@ 10 annual limit value , I understand the ambition behind the committee &apos;s proposal to threaten this .
I am confident that this House will have a future opportunity to have all its provisions successfully adopted in a less com@@ promised piece of legislation that will truly and comprehen@@ sively protect citizens from major resp@@ ir@@ atory damage .
I should like to make one more point , on which Mrs Nov@@ ak made some very interesting proposals in the Committee on Regional Development .
However , I know that you want me to be as practical as possible .
We dealt with it in a resolution in 2005 and we are discussing it again now .
Unfortunately , however , there is still a lot to be done and a long way to go in order to achieve a more drastic reduction in the manufacture and use of mines .
It seems in fact that the number of hectares eligible for g@@ rub@@ bing @-@ up has fallen from 200 000 to 175 000 .
He has earned a great deal of respect for his work , which he performed in a focused manner , cooperating well with all his fellow committee members .
I should like to make a very important point .
I also congratulate the Commission and , more un@@ usually , the Council Presidency , which da@@ red to take up its responsibilities .
It has no hesi@@ tation about presenting its own stance that is not always in line with that of the United States .
( RO ) Ladies and Gent@@ le@@ men , I would like to congratulate the European institutions for drawing up this report , which represents a true indicator of the importance the European Union gives to human rights and the promotion of democratic values worldwide .
Our out@@ going funds are , of course , incoming funds for our colleagues in the African parliaments .
Lastly , in relation to migration : Europeans and Afri@@ cans had the chance in Lisbon to send a clear political signal which would have placed human rights centre stage in our partnership .
We agreed to discuss nuclear issues and we accepted that these are a subject to be debated between us , because it was made clear from the beginning that no subject was t@@ abo@@ o .
Accordingly , export restrictions and discrimination against products are prohibited , and free trade must be guaranteed , although there are exceptions for measures in the interests of safety .
But , when this is done by financing from taxes instead of by productivity increases , the consumers pay just as much for their food in any case , only by different means .
If we wish to achieve a balance between free market legislation on the one hand , and the right to intellectual property on the other , we must nonetheless cur@@ tail intellectual property rights to a certain extent .
Lastly , the proposed repair clause is derived from and is in full accord with the principles of intellectual property protection .
If we intend to build a Europe founded on prosperity and security , as well as values and a shared sense of solidarity , we need the capacity to reflect on the future of the European social model .
We have to decide whether we want the Charter of Fundamental Rights , one day in the future , to be the Charter of Rights of Turkish citizens , the Charter of Rights of Moroccan citizens , the Charter of Rights of Israeli and Palestinian citizens ; we have to decide whether or not we want to give our Europe such a future , as otherwise the Europe of nations and states will prevail .
I refer to the question of Kosovo .
Over @-@ ha@@ sty liberalisation of this sector could also entail major risks , notably in terms of safety .
( The sitting was suspended at 13.@@ 50 and resumed at 15.00 )
Article 21 of the Charter prohi@@ bits discrimination on the ground of political or any other opinion - I repeat , any other opinion - which thus includes extreme opinions such as those expressed recently on German public television by the leader of the N@@ PD calling for changes to the border with Poland .
The two perpetrators were arrested .
It is true that , worldwide , there has been some good progress in terms of access to HIV @-@ related services , especially low @-@ middle @-@ income countries .
Fe@@ wer than half of all sex@@ ually active people always use a con@@ dom with a new sexual partner .
Their funds will also only cover a fra@@ ction of the amounts involved in a larger cross @-@ border crisis .
The rapporteur , Mr Eh@@ ler , has done good work in the report and showed a lot of willingness to compromise .
Both sides have benefited from it immen@@ sely but it has become badly im@@ balanced .
China &apos;s WTO obligations six years after it became a member are still too often un@@ met .
We wish you all the best .
Human rights , which include women &apos;s rights , are and need to be universal and defended in any context .
Furthermore , the Slovenian Presidency has asked , for procedural and official reasons , for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary part @-@ session in Belgium .
I am also f@@ ear@@ ful that there will be a lot of political pressure for a minimum level , just as with VAT or income tax .
The next item is the report by Johannes Blokland , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals - C6 @-@ 04@@ 39 / 2006 - .
The origins of the Agency are the Charter of Fundamental Rights and all the international conventions on human rights that we have in common amongst the Member States .
Unfortunately , the long @-@ term framework has not been yet accepted and some of the personnel issues have yet to be resolved .
in writing . - ( HU ) The European Union has a special responsibility to protect fundamental human rights , above all the rights of children .
The same left that is inflic@@ ting global warming on us and cannot be bo@@ ther@@ ed to ensure a high @-@ quality environment and a decent life for millions of residents of Camp@@ ania ; to top it all , I have heard talk of a national interest to be defended !
Ad@@ ul@@ ts and senior citizens who pass on knowledge and technical know @-@ how to younger people , particularly expertise in a trade or in business practice , can play an effective supporting role .
This approach was at least proposed , and when we received the report it was not yet clear when the Treaty would materi@@ alise .
We politicians could surely come up with more little tales like that from our local areas - and no doubt , Commissioner , you have heard a few yourself - which illustrate what we have to deal with .
I share the concerns of a previous speaker at the fact that referendums will not be held in Member States on the issue of the Lisbon Treaty .
Sadly , time will not permit me to answer them all .
Therefore , it is important that we do take account of the rights of children .
Madam President , on a point of order , could I , being an adult and having had some education , ask Mr Hann@@ on , who has , obviously , greater education than I , what his Latin expression means ?
Budget support is controlled .
I believe we can draw a lesson from Mrs Bhut@@ to &apos;s death , and that is that Pakistan needs a functioning democracy , the rule of law and a strong civil society to address the country &apos;s mounting challenges .
What moves should we expect from the Council in this matter , and when ?
We have therefore taken the firm decision to use every instrument available to us , such as legislation , structural funds and information and awareness @-@ raising campaigns , in order to improve this situation .
This issue can therefore still not be resolved very quickly .
I would like to thank Ms Trau@@ t@@ mann , who led the delegation to Rio and did it in a very good way .
If , however , he wishes part of the existing text to be deleted , I can only recommend that we vote against it .
I voted for this report in accordance with these observations .
The brutal rap@@ es are now being used by each of the war@@ ring fac@@ tions in eastern Congo , whether they are local tri@@ bal mili@@ tia or national army soldiers , as a symbol or power and as a means of intim@@ id@@ ation .
Thank you again .
I have not heard too many figures today .
I should like to say once again that it is not a contradiction to say that Iran is a very important country that has a vibrant society - potentially - and that we have to seek relations with it .
This forces me to declare my opposition to the resolution , because human rights and freedoms are absolute values that cannot be applied differently in different situations , and do not lend themselves to inequality between requests and condemnation .
We thus welcome information about the Buch@@ arest summit , where a decision on the construction of a complementary LT@@ BM@@ D system should be made .
However , some Member States have been allowed a transitional period up to the end of 2012 to implement the new rules .
Inten@@ se and constructive negotiations in the institutions followed .
Allow me to mention some essential elements of this agreement : firstly the part relating to international measures for improving , that is , reducing emissions .
Since yours is a small country , you might be able to diagno@@ se why we never arrive at solutions .
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr Lav@@ ro@@ v , said explicitly last Thursday that the reform of Europe &apos;s security architecture is a priority in Russia &apos;s foreign policy for 2008 .
Will the contents of our e @-@ mails here be monitored as a result of the measure you are promoting ?
One Member is able to speak in favour of the proposal and one against .
Mr President , I rise on this report because I absolutely des@@ p@@ ise the Common Fisheries Policy and the ecological disaster that it has caused for my country and the waters around it .
These agreements should help to resolve many limitations and problems facing Portuguese workers in Switzerland , for example , with regard to changes of job or profession , family reunification , relocation to another c@@ anton , or the social protection of workers and their families .
With reference to my speech of yesterday on the subject of liberalisation of the postal services , I would like to add a comment which I was previously unable to include owing to the restricted time available to me , and which concerns sources of finance for the universal service .
Viol@@ ations of human rights , state violence and sha@@ m electoral democracy are all factors to be taken into account in our attitude towards Iran .
They so@@ ak up water like a spon@@ ge and thereby cool the atmosphere .
For 29 years you and I have dis@@ agreed on constitutional matters , except for transparency .
That was published in the Official Journal on 17 December 2007 .
However , in order to avoid mis@@ understand@@ ings , may I remind you that it is not up to the Commission to lay down rules for Parliament .
I very much welcome the report &apos;s focus on systemic and general issues rather than on individual cases , for which , as you know , OLAF is independent in its investigations .
Germany is also putting obstacles in the way of OLAF &apos;s investig@@ ative work at local level , notably in cases of customs offences and export re@@ funds .
As far as the implementing measures are concerned , I will do my best to encourage dialogue between the customs authorities and the Community institutions , including the Commission , with which there has always been a good measure of close and productive cooperation .
The violent radic@@ alisation of individuals and groups in recent years has shown up one of the greatest weaknesses in our legal system and represented one of the greatest ons@@ lau@@ ghts on our democratic institutions .
Where should the consultations take us ?
They will find that the new legislation makes these procedures much simpler and that the products package will benefit European companies .
They account for 99 % of all European businesses .
I consider the word &apos; verify &apos; would be more appropriate than &apos; ensure &apos; , and I would be interested in the Commissioner &apos;s view whether &apos; ensure &apos; , in this context , is consistent with WTO stipul@@ ations and , in general , with the EU &apos;s commitment to free trade .
I also consider it important to have established contact points but also to have demonstrated that these will not create any additional red tape , given that contact points have already been set up under the Services Directive and in connection with the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications .
14 . (
A few facts will suff@@ ice to show how quickly this has changed the face of Sweden .
Def@@ ending our de@@ arly bought freedom demands un@@ fla@@ gging determination and tough , coordinated measures .
I think that the President should not allow such language to be used in future .
Some of you mentioned that it is unclear what role I am returning to .
Nevertheless , in the 21st century glob@@ alised and inter@@ dependent world , a truly prosperous future for Europe is impossible without ensuring it for the entire world .
Three years ago , with the integrated guidelines , we established a reliable set of reference points with which European and national reforms can be aligned .
I would like to emphasise this in particular because it is essential to wi@@ den the range of funding options for newly established businesses .
It is necessary in turn to study demographic changes and their effects on the public pur@@ se , the labour market and health service provision .
As far as the business environment is concerned , some of you advocated the internal market without protectionism , that is to say that an efficient market is what gives Europe a competitive advantage .
Without solid state finances in the individual Member States it will not be possible to set new investment priorities .
I also hope the Commission and the Council will continue to call very clearly for the release of political prisoners and for media independence .
In foreign policy , the EU will finally be represented by a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy .
Who here fears the voice of the people ?
Perhaps for those who wished to see the Constitutional Treaty ratified , the Lisbon Treaty is not a great achievement , but undoubtedly neither is it an achievement for the euro@@ scep@@ tics , who did not wish to see any new EU treaties .
Their rules on the use of force are strict and in line with the mandate laid down in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter .
How does the Council propose to do so more specifically ?
I support all the solutions proposed in the report , and I would place an emphasis on two .
Ra@@ ising a child is an enormous task .
I was very hear@@ tened in 2005 , when in Mal@@ aw@@ i , to meet a young trained agricultural scientist .
I fully share your view that the success of the territorial agenda and the Leipzig Charter depends on two conditions .
It lost eligibility for European support when funding for the current period was re@@ located to parts of the country where de@@ priv@@ ation is more widespread .
But the people concerned remain just as much at risk of social exclusion as before .
If we do not succeed in doing so in Belarus , we might yet do so in other countries .
As regards to the Commission actions to support civil society in Belarus , the Commission remains committed more than ever to supporting Belar@@ u@@ sian civil society , and our 2008 assistance plan is aimed in particular at c@@ em@@ enting Belar@@ u@@ sian civil society and independent media .
This is why it has to be said quite categor@@ ically that the ren@@ unci@@ ation of violence - the announcement by both sides of their intention to refrain from any further use of force and to focus all their efforts on the achievement of a negotiated settlement - is not an invention of this House but under@@ lies repeated attempts over the last few decades - and Ann@@ a@@ polis was essentially nothing more than a fresh attempt - to bring about dialogue without violence .
It means that more than 250 000 Israeli citizens are now exposed daily to Palestinian ro@@ cket fire from the Gaza Strip .
If Iran can smu@@ ggle its Fa@@ j@@ r ro@@ ckets into Gaza , Hamas may even be in a position to threaten Tel Avi@@ v .
The station is backed by Poland , Ireland , Lithuania , the Czech Republic and the USA .
On@@ going negotiations on bilateral agreements between the USA and certain Member States with regard to visas and PNR ( Pas@@ sen@@ ger Name Rec@@ ord ) ( debate )
The debate is closed .
We can perfectly well take on that job if the Commission keeps us continuously informed and brie@@ fed , and I think this will be something very important .
When the lion that ro@@ ars in the economic jungle gets wet , he dis@@ covers the virtu@@ es of solidarity .
I would strongly appeal for this positive experience to serve as a poin@@ ter for us in this matter too .
( PL ) Mr President , there are naturally certain consequences of having one &apos;s speaking time restricted to just one minute .
Finally , may I warmly congratulate and thank Mr Pa@@ asi@@ lin@@ na for his splendid cooperation .
It is parti@@ ci@@ ularly significant that the knowledge @-@ based societies working on the basis of the project principle will be able to take into consideration the priorities of the common European development policy , on the one hand , and the capabilities of individual Member States , on the other .
My dear friends and colleagues , colleagues in the most exact sense of the word , friends whom I have missed for the past year and a half .
there is no mention of high oil prices or to the consequences thereof ;
We are very much aware that , if it is attractive to produce milk in Europe , this can be attributed in great part to arti@@ fici@@ ally high prices and the restriction of competition from third countries .
For the CAP , I suggest that the measure is funding and that the assess@@ ors are the audi@@ tors .
What is the Commission doing , or what is it prepared to do , to share the good experience of how artists are being supported in the new accession countries , as well as new ideas and projects relating to this ?
We should not forget , however , the general aim of the Lisbon Agenda , namely employment and ultimately growth in these sectors , nor tigh@@ ten the requirements with bureaucratic obligations such as the collection of statistics , which can in fact also be obtained very easily in many sectors .
That is also the way to recover the support and trust of its citizens .
I believe that the real issue goes much deeper : it is about sustainability .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , I wish to make a single request of you when you go to the European Council : defend this institution when it tells you that the EU &apos;s social and economic situation requires more attention to be paid to social issues , requires us to make our economic policies coherent with our targets and our strategy legitim@@ ately drawn up for climate change and energy independence ; when it tells you that , if the Lisbon Strategy is to succeed , we need more economic coordination ; when it tells you that , if we are to deal successfully with the American sub@@ prime crisis , we need better regulated finance markets .
( DE ) Mr President , like the Green Group , I voted against the report on national quotas for milk .
That is why we need to be a bit cautious in the areas of trade and investment .
Our parliamentary delegation to Iraq will of course play its part in this process and I am sure that we can count on the Commission , on Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner , whom I congratulate , and on her courageous team in Bag@@ h@@ dad , compet@@ ently led by Ambassador U@@ usi@@ tal@@ o , as fundamental allies in the implementation of this road@@ map .
The Lisbon Treaty strengthens the role of the EU as global player .
The EU@@ FOR mission testi@@ fies to the commitment of the European Union to aid the stabilisation of the region .
Unfortunately , I do not have the same confidence in the independence of the inquiry into the missing , which will take place under the Cha@@ dian authorities , but , hopefully , with European Union involvement , that might be encouraged .
I therefore feel that he will not suffer any loss .
I agree with Mr R@@ ack &apos;s opinion that the consolidated text is in any case a useful aid in parliamentary decision @-@ making and for informing citizens .
This communication and the consolidation of the European perspective for the Western Balkan countries will be the main topic at the informal session of the European Union Foreign Ministers which is planned for the end of this month in Slovenia .
While I support the Commission proposal in every respect , it has to be acknowledged that new development of information and communication technologies in segments where there is commercial demand is taking place at in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating speeds .
( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
They need an individual approach on the part of the European Union , not a general neighbourhood policy that de facto treats Ukraine in the same way as countries that historically do not belong to Europe .
There are also some neg@@ atives though due to the fact that external growth resources can never replace internal resources : the economies that find themselves in this situation are often incapable of developing from the inside .
My special thanks go to Mrs Cre@@ ţ@@ u who drafted the opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality .
in writing . - ( FR ) I should like to make two comments on the G@@ ill report , which is essentially about organising research programmes with a view to making older people more independent through the use of information and communication technologies .
In recent years Parliament has in fact maintained a de@@ af@@ ening silence and not even challenged the lies put out by the Bush Administration .
The report suggests a number of possibilities that could be explored further , including the provision of health services .
Yes , we condemn the unfair treatment of candidates by the Russian state @-@ run media ; yes , we condemn the un@@ due use of force by the Russian police against prote@@ sters , but we do so in exactly the same way and with the same spirit as we would when dealing with similar happ@@ en@@ ings in any other country or union of countries , including our own .
Obviously , the Commission also shares your deep concern about M@@ eh@@ di Kaz@@ em@@ i and other similar cases .
You cannot have one without the other .
Secondly , we urge the Chinese Government to enter into constructive dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
He has said &apos; no &apos; to independence ; he has said &apos; yes &apos; to autonomy , and it is with this proposal that he should be given help .
This was clear to us as a delegation of MEPs who were in Dam@@ as@@ cus with the Dep@@ uty Prime Minister , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and representatives of Leban@@ ese opposition parties , such as He@@ z@@ bollah and A@@ mal .
I should like the Council to tell me what the situation is .
Therefore , in its motion for a resolution , too , this House will tomorrow be calling for the further development of evidence @-@ based EU guidelines on early detection , diagnosis and treatment of all widespread can@@ cers and the formulation of an urgently needed accredi@@ tation and certification procedure for relevant facilities .
It is consequently a good thing that the Euro@@ stars programme builds on the 7th Framework Programme for transnational enterprises and finances work in the sphere of science and technology put into effect by SMEs in cooperation with higher education institutions , research entities and other companies - large ones .
( HU ) Madam President , I warmly welcome this worthwhile report by Mr Gra@@ ça M@@ oura .
This , I assure you , is also my responsibility and I would like to invite you to cooperate and help to implement this agenda .
This will be the key to success .
However , it is absurd for the European Parliament to demand that the media take steps to maintain popular support for the role of the International Criminal Tribunal .
After all , a number of delegation members are present here .
Its persecution and intim@@ id@@ ation of this worker and active trade uni@@ on@@ ist is contrary to democracy and freedom and deserves our strongest condemnation .
That is wonderful !
We have had no satisfactory response from the Member States to our report of a year ago about such col@@ lu@@ sion .
The European Union should be an organisation which provides an example of un@@ compromising fight against genocide to the whole world .
We owe rem@@ emb@@ rance and justice not only to the victims of in@@ human systems ; first of all we owe it to present and future generations so that this situation does not happen again .
Such barriers also cause tangible losses to tourism in Poland .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I have listened carefully to what you have just said , and it supports a great many speakers who have emphasised the need to facilitate access to the European Union for the citizens of our neighbouring countries .
Mr Adam@@ ou &apos;s report certainly p@@ aves the way for this .
There is a strong link between volunte@@ ering and active citizenship : involvement in voluntary activities is a tangible expression of particip@@ atory democracy .
Mo@@ ving on to my report , it contains a number of practical suggestions as to how we can add value at European level .
What did we do here in the People &apos;s Party ?
It is because the new Con@@ gol@@ ese Government quite rightly wanted to ren@@ egoti@@ ate the licence conditions to ensure more of the revenue went back to the Con@@ gol@@ ese state , and we suspended the signing of the contract until a satisfactory agreement had been reached between the promot@@ er and the Con@@ gol@@ ese Government .
The information that we already knew should have been on the list was nevertheless not on the list , and there was a prolonged discussion back and forth until , quite recently , we finally obtained the information that we should have had in the first place .
F@@ aster and more effective suspension procedures should be used against Member States that do not carry out adequate checks .
Thank you for your attention .
I voted in favour of the report &apos;s recommendations .
The various Community funds are designed to stimulate the European economy and foster , socio @-@ economic cohesion and growth and sustainable development of European societies .
I could not support the reference to the Lisbon Treaty in paragraph 10 , which takes account of the new budget procedure arising from the Treaty of Lisbon .
At the same time , weal@@ th@@ ier countries should be encouraged to allocate funds for development aid to the poorest countries and to become more actively involved in humanitarian organisations .
To do this , we must invest in agricultural research and reflect reali@@ stically and responsibly , and I mean properly reflect , on the issue of GM crops .
This is bizarre .
For years , they have been ridi@@ cul@@ ed about milk lakes and butter mountains .
As a result of errors made by our negoti@@ ators when we acc@@ eded to the EU , we were obliged by the limits imposed on us to place significant restrictions on Polish agricultural production .
This will provide the basis for the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclu@@ sion that will be presented in 2009 .
We are doing this , but the Chinese are squee@@ zing us out .
This gives the European Union a moral right , but also a duty , to examine Chinese policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis Africa , since , as the rapporteur rightly stresses , China could significantly accelerate the process of sustainable development in Africa , but could equally harm it .
I spoke with all the heads of state : Angola , Moz@@ ambi@@ que , all of them .
In many ways China is Europe &apos;s rival in Africa , and several here have said that lec@@ turing a self @-@ respecting rising super@@ power will not do any good .
We will also be vigilant on the question of E@@ PA funding .
When we are designing all our development policies , we must define wellbeing within the framework of sustainable development .
We have recently signed a strategic partnership with Brazil , which should lead to the initi@@ ation of a first joint action plan by the end of this year .
Certainly , as the Minister has said , Cuba will not be the central issue at this Lima meeting , but all the same I want to say that the policy of the European Union is one of constructive engagement .
I should also like to ask your opinion of the statements by Mr Cher@@ to@@ ff in the Washington Post this week that exemption from the visa requirement will be conditional upon finger@@ printing by airlines .
European solidarity is not working - either towards the new Member States or towards Greece .
The PNR system will remain unchanged , the same as it is now , the same as it has been adopted and approved , and this is not about finger@@ prints being taken at travel agents &apos; or anywhere else .
We emphasise that we were against resources from the research budget being used for these projects .
Having said this , I now wish to mention one vital point : the civil nature of the project , an essential condition to ensure the transparency of operations .
After all , the lives of many individuals on the seas and in the mountains are at stake , along with our common security .
Of course this is not relevant to my question but let me tell you that I would not be speaking here now had I not run around to another part of the building .
As regards the latter , the European Union is actively supporting the United Nations &apos; efforts to accelerate the transition to democracy , reconciliation and development of the country , and is involved in consultations with its Asian partners .
The initial operational capacity was reached on 15 March , and , according to the plan , the full capacity should be reached by the end of June .
On behalf of my group and as has already been said by Mr Pur@@ vis , I have to mention that we have difficulties with a few paragraphs .
Here I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Commission a question : You previously said that you would present measures against airline nit@@ rogen dioxide emissions , against NO@@ x , and that this would happen this year .
Everyone has to make the effort ; that is why environmental costs need to be intern@@ alised .
Policy is there to facilitate , to ensure that there is sound , transparent and cost @-@ effective information on business performance .
I am greatly disappointed that the Council will not be there to discuss it .
Therefore , we take a di@@ m view of the fact that since the introduction of the euro , the prime lending rate has doubled .
Yesterday we heard an address by the Dep@@ uty Prime Minister of Georgia , Gi@@ org@@ i Bar@@ amid@@ ze .
It concluded , and I quote again , that it would , &apos; at the given moment decide on the possible revision of the Directive &apos; .
I believe that this coherence , as well as continuity in following up reports and policies supporting national parliaments , are vital if the E@@ ID@@ HR is to be credible .
I would like to say that in this case it is going to be very easy for me because everyone who has asked to &apos; catch my eye &apos; is female .
Also , contrary to what you said , Commissioner , and I am sorry to contradic@@ t you , I think that Amendment 17 , which I tabled myself and which has been included in the report , is very positive , as it rightly states that aid to producers can be increased when the cultivated area is less than the size of the base area for production , which I do think will benefit the sector , maintaining financial neutrali@@ ty , as well as resulting in full use of resources , and obviously giving great flexibility to the sector .
The encouragement of sport in the educational standards is an important factor for the psychological and physical development of our children , a major tool for the protection of their health .
There is no better example of this than the collective sale of TV rights , as is practi@@ sed by the English Premier League , for instance , with re@@ distribution to all clubs .
The Member States &apos; false figures about gambling addiction often conce@@ al pure protectionism and protection of their own revenue from gambling monopolies .
A resolution to the problem of banking secrecy in Singapore is essential if there is to be a real prospect of concluding a region @-@ to @-@ region free trade agreement .
These sections recognise the importance of ensuring accessible and sustainable public services - Amendment 7 ; the enforcement of labour standards through a dispute settlement mechanism - Amendment 14 ; and the need to treat environmentally friendly and fair trade goods differently when it comes to tariffs - paragraph 42 .
More than 10 years on it is clearly time to modify and strengthen these rules .
It brands trade @-@ unions , professional and mass organisations as &apos; lobby@@ ists &apos; .
We must try however we can to encourage this national dialogue , which needs to be conducted with due regard to the general interests of the citizens of Lebanon and their desire for prosperity , security and national independence .
Mr J@@ ør@@ gen@@ sen said this is not about harmonisation , but about the approxim@@ ation of laws , and in this respect I believe that Parliament , through its rapporteur Mr Nass@@ auer , the Council and the Commission , the Slovenian Presidency and Commissioner Barrot have all helped to promote an agreement that is acceptable to all .
The fight for poverty allevi@@ ation and development , as well as food security , is high on the Commission &apos;s agenda .
It is possible to provide new funds after 2013 as well , but only for the projects for which a financing agreement is signed by 31 December 2013 .
As someone who is closely involved with the regional policy of the EU , I am ke@@ en@@ ly aware of the need to develop cross @-@ border activities and strongly support cooperation between local cham@@ bers of commerce , public institutions and voluntary organisations on both sides of national borders .
Will you take it ?
If , in the 1970s , Germany and France had forced through a common employment policy for the Community , based on the political concepts which prev@@ ailed at the time , Europe &apos;s economy would now be in decline .
We have waters rich in minerals , energy and biological resources and we are ideally located as a maritime hub for Europe and the wider world .
I voted in favour of the report by my Polish colleague Mr Le@@ wand@@ owski on Parliament &apos;s estimate of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2009 .
We also question the value of EU financing for maritime research and a plan to survey and map w@@ re@@ cked ships and sub@@ merged archaeological sites , and we are critical of the idea that EU institutions should address the subject of maritime spatial planning .
As to obtaining the certificate of professional competence , the TRA@@ N Committee opted for eliminating a fixed number of training hours and replacing them with the obligation of a written examination followed by an oral examination as well , according to the decision of each Member State .
If access to the market is simplified , the restrictions on cab@@ otage are partially relaxed , and the basic working conditions in the sector are harmonised : both in regard to employment and to the attitude of individual Member States to enfor@@ cing the EU regulation , this will be hear@@ ti@@ ly approved by both entrepreneurs and employees in the sector .
I apologise to Mr Rom@@ agn@@ oli , who we have just heard .
Madam President , I just want to say that where there is no democracy , there is no peace for the Roma , or even for Itali@@ ans .
The results have started to appear but the programmes in operation require more time in order to be able to assess their efficiency .
Given that the sporting feder@@ ations of specific EU countries seek to impose rules on their members which restrict sports@@ men &apos;s and sports and women &apos;s possibilities with regard to contracts and freedom of movement , in clear violation of EU law , has the Commission studied the consequences of such practices from the point of view of freedom of competition ?
The industrial structures which were established over the course of 50 or 60 years have been responsible for the damage to our climate .
It is also written in such a way that ordinary Europeans can actually read the text and understand what we mean .
However , this does not imply a preliminary decision concerning the proposed part @-@ session from 20 to 23 April .
The mer@@ ging of the existing Regulations and Directive 2006 / 94 / EC will simplify and improve access to the road hau@@ lage market .
Unless we are all content with a global situation in which any hope of improvement will always be a pipe dream , we must sharply increase the pressure on those six countries that are responsible for almost 50 % of global greenhouse gas emissions .
They were thus able to visit the areas worst hit .
When I left Burma there were one hundred or so visa applications outstanding for UN agencies , and just over one hundred NGO applications .
Pre@@ vent@@ ing the planet from over@@ heating is all our responsibility .
However , I should point out that both employment policy and social policy are within the remit of the Member States , and the European Union supports and comple@@ ments their activities .
That has to do with our policy on climate change , which is increasingly becoming a fan@@ ati@@ cal moral crus@@ ade , subjec@@ ting Europe to a form of lifestyle regulation that sometimes goes over the top .
Obviously supermarkets , processors and consumers need to fulfil their responsibilities in this respect .
We are trying to work with them , but it is precisely because of the procedures that we cannot do so .
( Applause )
By not calling the Economic Partnership Agreements ( E@@ PA ) into question , merely referring to the need not to make development aid available only to countries that accept greater liberalisation of their markets , every positive aspect that might arise out of such aid has been abandoned .
2 . The arrest of political opponents in Belarus ( debate )
Pro@@ mot@@ ing democratisation in other countries must continue to be a central element of our foreign policy strategy .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Solana , I would first like to thank Mr Ku@@ hne for his report and for the way he went about it , which meant that we were able to achieve unity on almost all points .
The fact is that only 20 % of our armed forces can actually fight .
This follows in the foot@@ steps of Ν@@ Α@@ Τ@@ Ο by escal@@ ating the EU budget &apos;s contribution to weapons and military expenditure .
For example , the President and the State Department have repeatedly declared themselves openly in favour of Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union and have exer@@ ted pressure to this end .
I am therefore somewhat cautious when the demand is made here that in the event that a customer inform@@ s his bank that he wishes to switch to another we leave the risk , if he does not have his new bank account details in time , with the present bank .
You have done so without dil@@ uting or dimin@@ ishing the effectiveness of the proposal .
In spite of all the differences between the two shores of the mare no@@ stru@@ m , what un@@ ites us is even stronger than what separates us .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
It became my understanding that their preferred line was - and , it seems , probably still is - to provide exemptions and flexibility equally for all companies , large and small .
in writing . - We note that the PD@@ AB 3 contains positive measures , such as : to author@@ ise the total figure of € 8@@ 4@@ 9@@ m o@@ wed by Microsoft for ab@@ using their market position ; to vote through the funds under the E@@ US@@ F for Greece and Slovenia ; to fully fund the provision of blu@@ et@@ on@@ gue vacc@@ ine to combat the disease and to provide 50 % of the cost of implementation per Member State and provide savings on salaries and pensions for the Institution &apos;s staff .
We , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece ( K@@ KE ) , are voting against the joint resolution for the following reasons :
The resolution is yet more proof of the irre@@ ver@@ sible strategic agreement between the EU and the United States at the expense of the people .
We should therefore help young farmers to draw on Union funding for this purpose .
It gives some guarantee of the growing importance of farming aimed at promoting rural development .
In the West Bank too , a new course must be pursued , in which the credibility of the Palestinian Authority is bol@@ stered and the conditions for sustained economic development are systematically established .
We need some reflection and maturity to make sure that we can fully address the present situation and try to get Europe back on the road so that it is fully accountable to the citizens of Europe .
On 24 January 2008 , Mr President , I submitted a question to the European Parliament about the decision to reduce the budget for inviting the press .
rapporteur . - Madam President , following your ruling that there is no time for points of order , I will continue with my speech on the Wa@@ ste Framework Directive .
It is therefore vitally important that each of the Member States beha@@ ves responsibly and does not go looking for any loop@@ holes that might have remained in the legislation .
Finally , the European Union should promote the production of bio@@ gas and the compo@@ sting of waste .
The framework directive on water sets out a strategy to combat the chemical pollution of water .
It has often been the avant @-@ garde in European integration .
Those who do not know this should accept the blame for the fact that a rich society , which is based on the principles of justice and solidarity , like ours , operates in such a way that a country of poor Europeans would have more seats in this Parliament than Germany .
Organ@@ ised societies exist , and come what may , we have to protect human rights , while at the same time protecting the interests and rights of organised societies and organised states .
Be@@ ar in mind that inflation forecasts for the euro area for 2009 are well above the ECB &apos;s 2 % target .
So , who is resi@@ sting this ?
In the course of the debate on this regulation we have become more convinced of the need to go beyond the Commission &apos;s proposals for the Agency to create an agency with more independence and more decision @-@ making powers .
I would like to very warmly thank the President , Hans @-@ G@@ ert P@@ öt@@ tering , for having invited me to address the European Parliament .
At the same time , &apos; in@@ tra @-@ religious &apos; tensions also need to be adequately addressed .
Their prime objective is to pay out as much as possible to their shareholders , not to act in the general interests of the nation .
S@@ well@@ ed @-@ up with profits the oil companies respond by spec@@ ul@@ ating on the increased demand for their products in the emerging nations , hoping thereby to bur@@ st the bank .
There may also be options through the CO2 savings in the fishing industry .
For example - just to mention one point in addition - it is proposed to double the EF@@ F pre @-@ financing amount paid by the Commission after the adoption of the operational programmes from the current 7 % to 14 % of the total EF@@ F contribution .
The difficulty is that President Putin , Mr Med@@ ve@@ dev &apos;s predecessor , said much the same thing at the start of his term , yet we all know how things developed and what the present situation is like .
( L@@ V ) Ladies and gentlemen , the speech by Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner leads us to suppose that Parliament &apos;s resolution is an emin@@ ent example of political correctness ; perhaps even something like a cur@@ t@@ sey to Russia &apos;s new President , Mr Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Europe will only be able to stand firm vis @-@ à @-@ vis the US and Russia if it finally adop@@ ts a united front .
In a number of Member States , but above all in candidate countries , political parties and the media repeatedly claim that the introduction of &apos; same @-@ sex marri@@ ages &apos; or civil partnerships or the liberalisation of laws on abortion and eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia are compulsory on the basis of EU law and / or the acquis communautaire .
I should also point out that the Community is not competent to regulate matters concerning abortion and eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia .
The transport of dangerous goods can entail risks , as we are well aware .
In my view , that would also be useful in terms of risk assessment , the key phrase here being the collection of accident data .
Finally , I want to reaffir@@ m the need to support , through a range of measures , the production of traditional che@@ eses from the milk of these animals .
Nevertheless , it is important for the Member States to sign the memor@@ andum of understanding .
These vehicles can with@@ stand almost any accident but , unfortunately , most of the vehicles on our roads are medium or low priced .
Firstly , he should want to benefit from an intelligent car .
The only thing I would say is that users have not only to know what there is in the intelligent car , but also to know how it works , and need to learn how to operate the modern technology to which so often we have a theoretical access , but never actually use .
Accordingly , it is imperative that vehicles should be made more intelligent in the tru@@ est sense of the term , so that these things do not happen so often in future .
I find that it is absolutely important just now to send a clear message on behalf of the EU that we are ready to make a concrete commitment in the form of a peac@@ ekeeping mission in Ab@@ kha@@ zia .
Unfortunately , therefore , the Commission proposal to lift it represents a huge step backwards and is totally unacceptable .
Fisheries are in fact a particularly important pillar in the economic and social development of the outermost regions .
But the p@@ light of the Som@@ ali people continues , and the killing of civilians in that region , unfortunately , has now become a routine matter .
The first page also added that the purpose of the Lisbon Treaty was to help the EU work more democratically .
It is up to us to consider whether this is realistic or not .
This puts great pressure on some Member States and I think we have a special responsibility to make it work .
To that end , they must be given clear , relevant and concerted messages by the principal institutions .
I should like personally to thank the Commission and the Member States for repeatedly setting great store by getting the facts right .
the oral question to the Commission by Jan Marin@@ us W@@ ier@@ sm@@ a , Clau@@ dio F@@ ava , Kris@@ tian Vi@@ gen@@ in , Gi@@ anni Pit@@ t@@ ella , Adri@@ an Sever@@ in and Kat@@ alin Lé@@ v@@ ai , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the creation of a Roma finger@@ prints database in Italy - B6 @-@ 04@@ 52 / 2008 ) ;
I would much rather press for alternatives that are solutions , as my fellow Member , Mr W@@ ier@@ sm@@ a , has also stated .
This proposal is , in fact , the first specific European Union legislation aimed at food enz@@ y@@ mes .
The most controversial subject that has been raised in this proposal on flav@@ our@@ ings , from the start of the debate , has been the bi@@ ologically active principles that are naturally present in herbs and spices , which posed a major problem for her@@ b and sp@@ ice producers , as they found that they were unable to comply with the requirements of the proposal , given the special nature of their products : different harv@@ esting locations , times of the year in which they were harv@@ ested , eating habits in the various countries , etc .
The ministers actively oppose the notion that there must be a special reason for using dy@@ es in otherwise colour@@ less substances .
In addition , certain stone fruits such as cher@@ ries , pe@@ aches and ap@@ ri@@ c@@ ots naturally contain small amounts of hydro@@ cy@@ anic acid , yet we have been eating these fruits for thousands of years without any problems .
Pro@@ minent among them was the desire for food to be as natural as possible .
Today , this issue is also an example of a lack of European solidarity in the field of energy .
It must be done in order to minim@@ ise the risks .
In this respect , I must pay tribute to the work carried out by Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner and by the Commission in general in this area and in all aspects relating to the restoration of the rule of law .
Obviously , if we want one day Afghanistan to stop being a source of tension and to take its place of merit in the international community , we in the European institutions should seriously reconsider our present policies and the strategies that are being used .
There is a dedicated window , this is the Afghanistan Recon@@ struction Trust Fund ( ART@@ F ) for the justice sector to which we plan to contribute also from Afghanistan &apos;s bilateral programme and we have delivered on the process and promise already at the Rome Conference , but of course a lot of reforms are necessary .
Perhaps it was high time for this , though .
The effect on families , for instance , from the UK has been estimated to increase by 160 £ as a result of the legislation coming into force .
Although several Member States and the Commission prefer full ownership un@@ bund@@ ling , the Member States wanted to retain some flexibility , and the Council agreed to an option that provided for an independent transmission operator .
I wish to let it know that without this concept its alternative will not constitute a genuine alternative to ownership un@@ bund@@ ling , but rather a legal formula allowing certain Member States to be more equal than others in terms of opening up their markets .
As far as consumers are concerned , An@@ ne@@ xes A to the directives must in particular be transposed by the Member States ; they provide for better information , greater consideration of citizens &apos; concerns and , obviously , greater concern for the situation of vulnerable consumers .
This is no different in the gas sector .
There was broad consensus on this subject during the discussions in the Committee on Transport .
I also want to express my complete support for the eventual provision of a standard basis of solutions that allows a tailor @-@ made set of measures to be drawn up for each territorial level .
With regard to the remit of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , as provided for by the Treaties , we have to recognise the value of its work in 2007 .
The committee also chose to support a revised schedule concerning the assessment and payment of long @-@ term care cash benefits and the additional clarity relating to frontier workers who become unemployed .
There will be , apparently , no implic@@ ation for the Community budget .
( ET ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the rapporteur and the Committee who have done a great job on simplifying and updating these complex provisions .
The course the European Union is choosing today - placing greater importance on the free movement of capital than on self @-@ evident employment rights , as can be seen in a number of cases heard by the Court of Justice of the European Communities - suggests that we cannot content ourselves with the right to transfer our pension rights to demonstrate , o@@ sten@@ sibly , that the free movement of persons has been established .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , today , after 16 years , we have finally given the green light to simplification , unification and at the same time ti@@ ghter restrictions in regard to the granting and re@@ vo@@ king of air operating licences .
The establishment of li@@ aison bodies also enables us to provide practical assistance to those who work outside their home country , for example by answering questions on where and how they should apply for pensions .
Mr President , I wish to begin by expressing my con@@ dol@@ ences to the relatives of those who lost their lives and those who have suffered from the earthquake .
Mr President , there is an acknowled@@ gement in this report that enlargement has not been an un@@ qualified success .
It is true that we have not been able to put over the benefits of enlargement to our citizens .
One of these terrorists - Sam@@ ir Kun@@ tar - murdered a young Israeli man by dro@@ wning him and then took the man &apos;s daughter , sm@@ ash@@ ing her on rocks and be@@ ating her sk@@ ull with a rif@@ le but@@ t .
The continent itself needs to be strong in its condemnation and we need to push them and urge them and convince them that this is the right thing to do , because our people are looking to us to take definitive action in a situation which is quite appalling .
I have to say , regarding the new Article 68 , that it is a voluntary possibility for Member States to use and to top @-@ sli@@ ce up to 10 % of the direct payment , and then , according to the decisions by the Member States , to transfer some of that money into the sheep or go@@ at sector .
Commissioner , I understand how difficult it is for you to find solutions for problems on this scale , but we cannot give the sector the illusion that we are trying to cure their ills when this only leads to reduction and aband@@ on@@ ment .
So , thank you for the measures .
Mr Land@@ s@@ berg@@ is , do not tell un@@ tru@@ ths .
The finger@@ printing measure is not in compliance either with the European legislation or with any other instrument guaranteeing human rights in Europe .
in writing . - ( PL ) Madam President , Mr Brok &apos;s report under@@ scores the desire to improve our relationships with the East , and that is why I supported it .
Today , Parliament is sending out a clear message : it no longer wants Mugabe and his regime .
Now , of course , there are points that need to be clarified or adapted .
China has been able , through dialogue , to resolve the issue of Mac@@ ao .
I do understand that Mr Posselt and others are saying that we should act anyway , even if we do not keep to the Rules of Procedure .
The gra@@ ves we are talking about are in the line of control .
This decision eventually cost him his life .
There is a danger then that , due to the introduction of this list , biom@@ etric checks will become the exception rather than the rule .
in writing . - ( HU ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we all agree on the necessity of amending the Schengen Bor@@ ders Code so that its provisions are consistent with the stipul@@ ations of the Visa Information System .
It emphasises that all European States have the right freely to determine their foreign policy and their alli@@ ances , and so on .
We should leave all that in the past , although it may be necessary to return to it .
The Warsaw Pact has disappeared but we have not offered any response other than the ce@@ as@@ eless expansion of NATO .
In the midst of our work for ever closer integration of the European Union , the Georgian @-@ Russian conflict has come like a bol@@ t from the blue to remind us that force makes decisions even in the 21st century .
It is high time that their wealth of experience , creativity and resi@@ li@@ ence was available to our economy .
Re@@ gre@@ ttably it has one feature which has already been condemned : it is an internal commitment to the contradictions within Europe , with those of us who want more of Europe and those who would like there to be less of it ; it is therefore a forest of empty rhetoric and a desert of specific content .
The Agreement also encourages cooperation in the field of scientific research .
( BG ) Mr. President , colleagues , I wonder at the things that were said today , in this hall , and no one under@@ scored the point of preserving the confidence of information .
( PL ) Madam President , may I begin by congratulating Commissioner Reding .
It will be easier for people to take telephone numbers with them when changing operators .
Secondly , we are concerned because the Commission would appear to be aware that there is a legislative lac@@ una when it initi@@ ates procedures to amend directives .
It is therefore of exceptional importance that complaints be acted on within a reasonable time .
The second part of the report , however , continues with 46 paragraphs containing recommendations , inv@@ itations or requests for this principle to be observed .
The S@@ art@@ ori report is a fundamental step forward , harmonising the classification of substances and the labelling and packaging standards of hazardous substances and mix@@ tures .
We talk a lot about reducing CO2 produced by vehicles , particularly trucks .
Nevertheless , we cannot fail to admire this age @-@ old culture .
I am well aware that in this House there are all kinds of views regarding free trade .
A unified type @-@ approval system offers citizens the protection of an EU @-@ wide directive and promotes an increase in the number of environmentally safe vehicles , which is very important .
I should like to reiterate the rapporteur &apos;s proposal , which seeks to strengthen European gender equality legislation .
Sanc@@ tions should be directed against actual people , for example with a view to restricting their movements or con@@ fis@@ c@@ ating their assets , and not against the victims of their mali@@ cious behaviour .
In France , the Council of the Paris Bar Association , by rejecting the hon@@ or@@ ary membership of retired lawyer Eric Del@@ cro@@ ix instead of taking his defence , brought dish@@ on@@ our on itself .
However , no one should try to export or import models for others : each developing country must adopt the proper tim@@ esc@@ ales for its own growth capability .
The issue of the European child health needs to receive all the attention due , taking into consideration the serious problems that all Member States are dealing with .
The views of the European Parliament will naturally be a key component in our discussions and in the revi@@ val of the debate that we now want to see through to completion .
The average farmer needs more time to fill in forms about all manner of things than he has to do his normal work on the farm .
In this respect , the directive should prove very helpful to us .
The Bureau adopted a unanimous decision yesterday evening - also at Mr F@@ az@@ ak@@ as &apos;s suggestion - which we intend to publish now that the Conference of Presidents has been informed , as is the case : thus the September II part @-@ session will take place here in Brussels as well .
This involves consent to safe and legal abor@@ tions .
This is why I voted against this motion for a resolution .
It is precisely for this reason that it is important to distinguish between commercial and essential public services .
The European Union should cooperate with the government of Mau@@ rit@@ ania and with the African Union in order to resolve the situation .
Our presence on the ground , raising awareness amongst the people as to what democracy is all about and explaining how they can now play their part in it after a difficult period of preparation is surely a venture worth investing in , as we are indeed doing .
The law works when people know what can be pen@@ alised , but things need to be kept in proportion .
These mur@@ ders are connected with the super@@ sti@@ tious practices current in the area and are based on the belief that al@@ bin@@ o body parts such as the feet , hands , hair and blood will make a person healthy , wealthy and rich .
7 . Follow @-@ up to the Monter@@ rey Conference of 2002 on Finan@@ cing for Development (
Opening of the sitting
Min@@ or crops are crops that are only cultivated in small amounts , such as tom@@ atoes , Brussels s@@ prou@@ ts and tu@@ lips .
We would all like fresh , healthy , local food at affordable prices without hazardous resi@@ dues from plant protection products .
The new term civil dialogue has even been co@@ ined to describe these policies .
To conclude , the Commission would like to assure this House that it will continue to work closely with Member States to ensure adequate and effective enforcement of the directives on unfair commercial practices and misleading comparative advertisement .
There will be an improvement in marketing .
It must be said , however , that among our fellow citizens and until recently there were mixed percep@@ tions of the euro .
We hope that recent experiences convince people of the need to face up to change in Europe , restoring the real economy to the centre and ensuring better cohesion and connection between the ECB and the European institutions responsible for laying down political and planning strategy .
This target may seem a bit absurd .
Looking back at our achievements , we must also be critical and own up to mistakes that have been committed .
I will explain why by reading out a letter to me from James Mo@@ w@@ bra@@ y , who is a farmer near Sk@@ eg@@ ness in my region .
The negotiated agreement reflects by and large the structure of a conventional aviation safety agreement ; it is based on mutual trust in each other &apos;s systems and on the comparison of regulatory differences .
The low turn@@ out in European elections is a logical consequence of the fact that European citizens do not know what positive contribution European legislation can make to them and they do not believe their vote can have any influence .
We adopted an EU directive protecting consumers from unfair commercial practices and misleading advertising back in 2005 .
Let us not hide the fact that the compromise was extremely difficult .
This report is one more step in affir@@ ming the rights of individuals and guaranteeing their security .
Mr President , the report by the rapporteur , Mr Capp@@ ato , indicates that there are major shortcomings with regard to access to EU documents .
It is not about exports at all , it is about the European internal market .
I would like the Commission to carry out an impact assessment to see how great an effect the advertisements have had on sales of these pharmaceutical products .
I am just wondering why the two have been divor@@ ced at this stage in the proceedings .
That is why it is important under the presidency now to expand this idea of partnership with the East , that we look to the East and to the Balkans because they are the fault lines within the European Union at the present time , not only because of political instability but also because of our inter@@ dependence on energy and economic activity .
Madam President , I would like to extend the warm@@ est Est@@ onian support for the Czech presidency .
Of the economic , diplomatic and institutional crises weakening Europe , the last one is the only one whose outcome depends solely on Europeans .
Instead , I abstained because I believe the disability amendment is important for those of us who care for those who do not speak , have no voice and are not listened to .
I do not like hom@@ ophobia , but legisl@@ ating against it in community law is absurd .
I consider even the publication of MEPs &apos; attendance regi@@ sters and voting lists dangerous without extensive additional channels of explanation .
This is my first short , or not so short , analysis , and we will have to try to work in order to get this durable ce@@ ase@@ fire in order then to be able to go on and get peace negotiations under way with a new American administration .
It is a tragedy that is also be@@ falling the international community , because what is happening now has not happened overnight , but has been built up through re@@ armament , through the smuggling of weapons and through ro@@ cket fire over a long period .
Commissioner , your diagnosis of a lack of inter@@ connection could not be more accurate .
The media must be free to operate within the law and publish their material in the country .
This might be a good occasion for an appeal to provide more new investment for this city and its region .
I could highlight many things , but one particular thing we have problems with in Europe is horse transport .
Due to trade needs , animals are transported over specified distances which are often too long , and which require a significant amount of time to cover .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I unfortunately have to inform you that we have just learned that the headquarters of the United Nations agency responsible for assisting refugees in Gaza has just been hit by sh@@ ells fired from Israeli tanks .
The following amendments have been proposed :
( The President cut off the speaker )
( RO ) Energy policy is and will continue to be a priority for the EU .
There is talk of long @-@ term measures .
The same is true for coal ga@@ si@@ fication technology , which is very important as an additional source of gas supply - it means diversification of gas supply .
It was a very tough debate , but I believe that all elements are there and we just need to continue to work very vigorously to implement the ones that we have agreed on and the proposals that have been agreed in this House .
In accordance with Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of the debate on the oral question by Mr Rem@@ ek .
The pace of these negotiations will be set by the regions concerned to ensure those objectives and coverage match their own integration processes , capacity , needs and political priorities .
Wil@@ derness in Europe ( short presentation )
( PL ) Mr President , it was the poet Z@@ big@@ nie@@ w Herbert who said , &apos; We must learn to say &apos; no &apos; ( ... ) &apos; no &apos; is a very significant part of speech .
The criminal and other sanctions provided for in the directive will , I am sure , be a frigh@@ tening deter@@ rent which will help to limit and prevent the unacceptable exploitation of illegal immigrants .
It provides us with the moral re@@ assurance which we have o@@ wed ourselves since the Return Directive .
Pre @-@ commercial procurement also represents an important opportunity for SMEs .
If we concentrate all our services in the European Quarter , it gives real estate developers enormous opportunities to ask very high prices , which we have already seen in many cases .
While the objective of the European Union is the preservation of cultural diversity , minority languages and groups face the threat of extinc@@ tion or assimil@@ ation .
This is an obvious and welcome approach .
However , in terms of relations between the majority and minority , I would like to advise you of two aspects : 1 ) I feel that not only members of a minority should be involved in measures of this kind , but maj@@ orities must also deal with issues relating to minorities , to the same extent , precisely in order to support and protect what we call &apos; unity in diversity &apos; , which is taking place in Romania .
They have a black @-@ coloured passport and for that reason , they are called &apos; bl@@ acks &apos; or &apos; auber@@ g@@ ines &apos; .
It is not about shi@@ ver@@ ing around a cand@@ le in a cave : it is about a future that can be more positive and attractive than today &apos;s .
We know the intentions and the plans of the regional forces and tendencies which support separation and encourage it .
( The President informed the speaker that he had exceeded his speaking time )
The government of Kosovo has to understand that respect for the rights of minorities is a European standard .
This is why the Romanian delegation from the PPE @-@ DE Group , apart from the MEPs of Hungarian origin , is going to vote against this resolution .
The European industry is going with us on this , and we are supporting the associated projects as part of the European economic stimulus package , as you all know .
What I would very much like to highlight in what a previous speaker from the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats said , and it is something I absolutely agree with , is that I am completely convinced that , if we concentrate solely on cars without being aware , at the same time , of how we need to re@@ structure the transport sector and of how the public transport sector will look in ten years &apos; time , we will fall far short of what we need to deliver .
We can see this from the car sector , where , I agree with Mr Sac@@ coni , we can pre@@ su@@ me that more than 2 million jobs are at risk .
I would argue that European coordination is required , and that it should be directed towards two areas : innovation , in relation to the climate change package and , if I may mention it again , to the Sac@@ coni emissions regulation , and the social sphere .
Thirdly , accelerate the renewal of the vehicles on the road .
The recent terrorist attack in Mum@@ ba@@ i demonstrated the use@@ fulness and the need for reinforced coordination of protection for citizens of Member States of the European Union at such times .
There is no doubt that there is a fear of rising protectionism , so we are all very well aware of the challenges ahead of us .
I guess that you observed that , and that is one of the reasons why I now have the obligation to answer your question .
It was tabled , after all , last December .
O@@ ral explanations of vote
Finally , it recognises that liberalisation of services connected to the Internet , such as tel@@ ec@@ oms , has led to a boom in infrastructure investment , so I believe we should be cautious about applying further regulation on such industries , as the Commission seems intent on doing at the moment .
We should also like to call on Thailand to ratify the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refu@@ ge@@ es and the 1967 Protocol .
But three things jump out at us immediately when we speak about the Middle East .
That is the question .
I would also like to say that in recent weeks , our strategic relationships with the United States and with the Russian Federation have taken great steps forward .
As mentioned , the truth is that in practice , the two partners could very well cooperate with each other , mutually comple@@ menting one another .
We have the resources .
We must capitali@@ se on the current climate in relations with the US to open up a new chapter in this area to boost our power at a global level .
It is not possible to work on an EU security and defence white paper if the Member States do not trans@@ pose the document into their national strategies .
It was a conference on water .
It was a ministerial conference on one of the key issues on which there needs to be cooperation across the Mediterranean , which is going to create conflicts , is a question of survival and is also the target of some possible large projects in the Mediterranean , involving solar energy , transferring water and many other things .
We also need to promote the South @-@ South market and cooperation between the countries of the South , and not just be obs@@ essed with a big free market in the Mediterranean , which is not prec@@ eded by cooperation between countries that have deeply ent@@ ren@@ ched conflicts , one after the other .
As we know , 98 % of the children in our world living in extreme poverty are living in developing countries .
This is also why I support research and free access to the results of this research , as well as specialists .
For the plenary my group decided to re@@ table some amendments that came from the Members of the committee that is kno@@ wled@@ geable on the subject .
They need not be repeated , but only on the condition that we work together .
VAT reductions across the world are used to encourage people to buy energy @-@ efficient and environmentally @-@ friendly fri@@ dges , free@@ zers and other goods that use up large amounts of energy , and cheaper prices for these products will help the less well @-@ off .
Regar@@ dless of the need to strengthen procedures aimed at combating the use of illegal workers , it is unacceptable that this directive pun@@ ishes both the trans@@ gres@@ sor and the victims .
We stand up to China over Tibet ; we stand up to China over human rights ; it is time we stood up to China over Taiwan .
I am firmly in favour of strengthening the ES@@ DP .
Petitions : see Minutes
We know that physical education pre@@ pa@@ res children for a healthy lifestyle , passing on important social values such as self @-@ discipline , solidarity , team spirit and fair play .
The resolution that Parliament adopted in early December was a timely and strongly welcomed initiative .
One of the main fears that scep@@ tics have concerns the lack of a requirement for the company to own a sufficient amount of share capital to protect creditors .
A unified procedure should be established for granting asylum , as well as unified standards which enable decisions to be made about who should be recognised as a refugee or whether a person is in need of international protection .
In January 2006 , the Commission adopted an action plan towards an integrated internal control framework , again with the aim of obtaining a positive statement of assurance from the EC@@ A .
Key definitions are fra@@ med differently in different countries and the number of Member States that have independent public over@@ sight is a long way short of 27 .
We have reduced rolling resistance and included gear shift indicators in this proposal , which was not in the original proposal .
As I say , ty@@ re pressure monitoring systems are very important , because under @-@ infl@@ ated ty@@ res - much to my shame , the United Kingdom is one of the worst cul@@ pri@@ ts for having under @-@ infl@@ ated ty@@ res - are a cause of accidents .
I was rapporteur on the Mobile Air Con@@ di@@ tioning ( MAC ) Directive relating to their use in mobile air conditioning .
B@@ RE@@ F@@ s are drafted through a transparent procedure with the broad participation of the Member States , industry and other relevant agencies .
I would like to offer my thanks for the constructive contributions that I have heard Members make to the debate today .
The decisions have been transferred to EU level , but transparency and public access have not followed .
This meant the elimination of the leaders and eli@@ tes of a nation fighting for its own , and Europe &apos;s , freedom .
Their abuse of their position of domin@@ ance continues , with producers exploited at every turn , even to the point of having to pay for their promotions .
As far as ty@@ res are concerned , I believe the efforts to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of better ty@@ res with less rolling resistance , as well as the introduction of electronic ty@@ re pressure monitoring systems , to be worthwhile .
Experience shows that such a museum will be designed as propaganda for an increasingly federal EU .
We would also like to point out that this report contains wor@@ dings that could lead to a more protectionist policy for agricultural goods on the part of the EU .
Obviously , concerns about state intervention are of the highest ranking but , given the nature of the damage caused by under @-@ consumption and a shr@@ in@@ king manufacturing base , some relief at the level of government expenditure is necessary .
Rein@@ forced rules on the accommodation of ships in dist@@ ress in a place of refuge will make sure we can prevent shipping accidents from turning into environmental disasters .
We should give him particular credit for that .
We surely must put the environment and the health of those living close to transport links above having un@@ con@@ ge@@ sted roads .
I should like to start by asking my fellow Members not to be fo@@ ol@@ ed by the off @-@ putting statistics some have put forward .
The Commission has strengthened financial instruments at a European level with the aim of helping the Member States to overcome the crisis and its social consequences .
During the last year , it received EUR 3@@ 25 million in subsidies , which proved to be inadequate .
It is essential to keep in mind that this is an industry , as has already been said , that is important to Europe because of its quality and value , because of the research that it under@@ takes and because of the environmental quality that is associated with it .
Any delay in the adoption of this regulation should , therefore , be avoided , especially if we want to ensure the credibility of the Community at international level and to promote the process of the recovery of this stock .
This March , as Mr P@@ öt@@ tering has just said , marks the thir@@ tieth anniversary of his death , in 1979 .
Anyone who believes that the crisis can be overcome by continuing this policy with just a few modifications has completely failed to understand the situation .
Do@@ ing nothing and letting the markets decide has failed .
The employment issues must be top of the agenda right now .
Mr Verheugen , when you spoke today , you said something which is true : we do not know how long the crisis will last .
I am conscious that there are many differing views across this House .
It is odd that the report mentions rail , sea and inland water@@ way transport yet neglec@@ ts this sector , one of the principal contribut@@ ors of carbon emissions .
The law on the duties and legal powers of the police , amended in 2007 , must be monitored closely in order to prevent violations of human rights .
Therefore , we need to support the Sloven@@ es and Cro@@ ats in their search for a sensible solution to the border problem but , at the same time , to open all the chapters in the negotiations .
What preparations is the Council making in the run up to the G8 summit in July and the climate change conference in Copenhagen later this year in order to move international negotiations forward on climate change ?
In March 2008 , the Commission opened proceedings to establish whether Visa Europe &apos;s M@@ IF constitutes an infringement of Article 81 .
Therefore , if we achieve visa @-@ free travel , we should also consider how we will handle de@@ port@@ ations , extradition agreements and similar issues , in order that ...
Up to now , several thousand people a year - all of whom are refugees - have made this su@@ preme effort to cross 5000 m high passes .
That is why I fail to understand this ob@@ session by the Chinese Government both to tw@@ ist reality and to insist on blocking the round of talks again and again .
According to a modern understanding of human rights and international law - which hopefully China will also soon share - the international community is required express concern about human rights in all parts of the world , particularly in very blat@@ ant cases .
We defend the rights of small nations even when this proves to be bo@@ ther@@ some or uncomfortable .
We support the coupling of agricultural aid to production , allowing the ag@@ ri @-@ foodstuffs production of countries such as Portugal to grow and , in general , allowing its primary sector to modern@@ ise .
We urgently call for calm and restraint , and urge the national authorities of Guinea @-@ Bis@@ sau to fully investigate these events and bring to justice those responsible .
- ( SK ) Two weeks ago , Mr President , you brought us some very sad and horri@@ fic news .
The EP@@ As thus operate in a way which con@@ forms to WTO rules .
There is only one that meets this criterion , and even then , one of the principal countries in this region of the Caribbean , Haiti , has not signed the agreement , which surely says a great deal .
As regards Côte d &apos;@@ Ivoire , we would like very clear assurances .
We did not always agree on issues such as how to deal with notification in relation to nan@@ otechn@@ ology and what should be done in terms of labelling , but we managed to reach an excellent compromise .
We still have much to do in that area .
I would just like once again to say to Mr Schnell@@ hardt that yes , de@@ od@@ or@@ ants work differently on different people , but the claim is nevertheless made that they &apos; keep you swe@@ at @-@ free &apos; .
The European Union can perhaps learn a lesson from the EUR 2 billion that the China @-@ African Development Fund inv@@ ests in Africa .
For example , I remind you that the Commission , just as with the majority of other aid providers , will only grant budget support to countries that have implemented an International Monetary Fund programme .
Obviously , other approaches will have to be devised for countries that are still not eligible for budget support , but the MD@@ G contract already constitutes an important contribution to improving the effectiveness of aid and the acceler@@ ation of progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
achieve growing bilateral benefits for an ever @-@ increasing number of citizens
There was much debate , and I would like to inform the Commissioner , if he is present , that I would also have liked to recommend that European Union officials be able to communicate with the media more openly than has hitherto been the case .
In addition , the Commission can certainly not be alone in communicating with the citizens on the issue of Europe .
I believe that particular attention must be focused on the EU &apos;s convergence regions both now and in the future , so that the great differences between them can be significantly reduced as soon as possible .
For this reason , we should put the emphasis on making it into a separate objective , alongside economic and social cohesion .
We have listened - or we should have listened - to the people of Ireland , who made it perfectly clear in their referendum that they did not want this Treaty .
This is why I think that Member States must be encouraged to establish a system of territorial governance based on an integrated &apos; bottom @-@ up &apos; approach , which also allows more active civil participation .
Therefore , given the importance of artistic subjects , I am in favour of Europe @-@ wide coordination of their teaching in educational institutions .
It is estimated that in Europe some 500 000 women have been victims of this crime , which is why it is vital that the European Commission and the Member States work together to harmonise existing legislation in order to prevent and eliminate F@@ GM in the European Union .
We found that banks that we thought were independent were completely ent@@ ang@@ led with other banks in different countries , and we have to deal with that problem .
We particularly need to assess whether the current annual Plan@@ ning and Review Process involves too much planning , especially in comparison to the presentation and evaluation of the results achieved .
In addition , we must not forget that a mid @-@ term review of many of the multiannual programmes will take place in this House in 2010 .
This seems very important to me because , finally , we will have consistency between the results of the elections and the budgetary guidelines to be over@@ seen by the Commission .
the report by M@@ arian @-@ Jean Marin@@ esc@@ u , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations ( EC ) No 5@@ 49 / 2004 , ( EC ) No 550 / 2004 , ( EC ) No 5@@ 51 / 2004 and ( EC ) No 5@@ 52 / 2004 in order to improve the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system - C6 @-@ 0@@ 250 / 2008 - , and
However , we should not only be concerned about improving functionality here and now in the current crisis .
I must also mention that 2009 , the year of creativity and innovation , is a year in which we can make a step forward towards this standardisation , if this agreement is signed among mobile phone manufacturers , albeit on a voluntary basis for the time being .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
Mr Brown &apos;s speech was long on hyper@@ b@@ ole but sing@@ ularly failed to mention the central fact that the United Kingdom will , under his leadership , have the longest and deep@@ est recession of any industrialised nation .
This will require proactive interventions by Member State governments .
- ( FR ) Mr President , the Presidency conclusions from the last Council make for am@@ using reading .
However , economic depression is not a time for moral depression .
It appears that it was President Sarkozy who succeeded in convincing the other Member States that there was no need to draft proposals making employment a priority of the European Union &apos;s operations .
- Madam President , to save time the Socialists are prepared to accept Amendments 8 and 10 as additions , but we will vote against if they are not accepted as additions by the PPE @-@ DE Group .
It is an important , and un@@ easy , challenge for all European political leaders to explain to their citizens that their own security must be defended in Kabul .
In this light , we support the recommendation of the report .
So I too would like to join the call for MEPs to enter into much closer and more intensive cooperation with US counterparts .
For a long time Europe and the United States have been allies vital to prosperity , development and globalisation .
To this end , we are working successfully with Turkmenistan in the area of border management and in the fight against terrorism , Islamic extremism , drugs trafficking and human trafficking .
As you are aware and as the President @-@ in @-@ Office has just said , it is the Council - unanimously , by the way - that decides on such matters .
The Eastern Partnership means the chance for cheaper visas , better economic cooperation and financial support for civil society .
Subject to progress made towards democracy , human rights and the rule of law , we remain ready to deep@@ en our relations with Belarus .
The European Union has made a commitment in this regard to monitor very closely developments concerning the following five key issues : political prisoners , electoral law , freedom of the media , freedom of NGOs and freedom of assembly .
This is one of the most important lessons of the history of the past decades , and this is why it is important that we remember the hor@@ rors of tot@@ ali@@ tari@@ anism .
It is not a matter for academic study .
- The next item is the report by St@@ av@@ ros Lam@@ br@@ ini@@ dis , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet .
Firstly , it must be made clear that ships for scra@@ pping that incorporate hazardous substances should be regarded as hazardous waste and hence should fall under the Basel Convention .
This group includes particularly the hom@@ eless , families in difficulty , the unemployed , single parents , migrants , asylum seekers and people of advanced age or with limited resources .
I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council for appropriate decisions and coordination in terms of social and agricultural policy .
I therefore thank the Commission for its proposal on this matter , and I thank Mr Si@@ ek@@ ier@@ ski for the report which we are discussing today .
It is estimated that 43 million people in the EU are at risk of food poverty , a figure that has risen continuously in recent years .
And I stress &apos; compens@@ ated &apos; .
In my opinion , it calls into question some of the essential corner@@ stones of our economic system , such as free competition and the basic principles of the social market economy .
The position of farmers in the food supply chain can only be strengthened by cooperation and the inclusion of shared responsibility .
Many of the deals involving property developers and Spanish local government are , frankly , the result of corruption .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Si@@ ek@@ ier@@ ski &apos;s report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
The second day is very often devoted to opportunities in terms of ge@@ ological exploitation .
Unfortunately , we all know that this amendment does not stand a chance , as this House never loses an opportunity to show its most politically correct side and always op@@ ts for more bureaucracy and more decision @-@ making over the heads of European citizens .
We must also h@@ unt out traffi@@ ckers from their networks with intelligence and specialised forces , and at the same time tou@@ gh@@ en up criminal laws in the destination countries .
For example , we need to ensure that Libya finally has an asylum system .
With the Commission &apos;s proposal as a starting point , all of the compromises represented improvements on the current situation and it proved possible to resolve the most difficult issues with the French Presidency even before Christmas .
Education is the key issue in the integration process .
But if we are to increase the impact , we also have to retain the environmental integrity of the programme .
Finally , I would like to refer back to Ms Mc@@ A@@ van , who made a reference to the financial crisis and the meeting in London today .
In 2005 the Commission adopted a communication to launch the debate on a Community approach regarding the ec@@ ol@@ ab@@ elling programmes for fishery products .
It strikes me that time is of the essence , not only in the fishing industry , but also in a number of other sectors .
Numerous useful changes have been made to the texts and the results are very balanced .
It would lead meanwhile , and paradox@@ ically , to the gh@@ et@@ to@@ isation of our societies , to the bl@@ ur@@ ring of identities , and to the acc@@ ul@@ tu@@ ration of all , whether migrants or the original inhabitants of the host country .
Europe has over 50 million disabled citizens , and it is therefore imperative that we make every measure to improve their well @-@ being .
We owe our parents and grand@@ parents a firm parliamentary message , and that is what we have produced today .
This is unacceptable , which is why I welcome the adoption of this text by the European Parliament , despite the incomprehensible vote against by the right .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report specifically because it ur@@ ges the Commission to utili@@ se current scientific evidence to protect EU citizens from the potential haz@@ ards of electro@@ magnetic fields ( EM@@ F@@ s ) .
Let us not forget that there are many EU laws that already exist in the energy markets , and it is precisely because these laws were not being respected that the revision of this law needed to take place .
The big question has always been , for me , whether or not this is sufficient .
CE@@ POL .
Based on the results of the impact assessment , the Commission submitted a policy proposal last year based on the &apos; principle of due di@@ li@@ gence &apos; .
We would rather only admissible petitions came our way and we need to work very hard with citizens so that they know what we can and cannot deal with .
The vote will take place on Wednesday 22 April 2009 .
The most significant points of the regulation are the product of Parliament &apos;s commitment during the difficult negotiations with the Council .
There is no legal recourse at all if they get it wrong .
We need to make progress in this area .
We are also deciding today - much too late - on regulatory action for credit rating agencies .
From the sale of 400 tonnes of gold ?
We asked you for a legislative initiative in this area last September .
Mr President , after 10 years in this Parliament I did not think anything could surprise me any more , but I was shocked by the fat@@ u@@ ity of the proposal of extending the common fisheries policy to recreational sea an@@ gl@@ ers , requiring them to log every catch and count it against their national quota .
I cannot support the ignor@@ ance shown by the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions in the wor@@ dings in this report .
What do the confidential accounts contain ?
He in turn has asked to speak on a personal matter and so I give him the floor .
It is anything but workable , Mr Simp@@ son .
B@@ ans on cab@@ otage operations result in un@@ laden journeys , which we cannot and do not want to afford , either financially or from an energy or environmental point of view .
I think it is right that , where local transport - as Mr Jarzembowski has referred to - is not included , there are public service contracts which mean that the companies will reach the same sort of standards .
Thus far the European Coll@@ abor@@ ation on Dem@@ enti@@ a Project has provided accurate , qualitative and quantitative data and analysis of the burden of Alzheimer &apos;s disease in the European Union , which has been published by Alzheimer Europe in the Dem@@ enti@@ a in Europe Y@@ ear@@ book .
That is why I mentioned that the money , which actually amounts to EUR 71 million , has also triggered the financing of large infrastructure projects , which are more than EUR 2.5 billion .
Those states must notify any new state aid measure to the ESA and get its approval before putting it into effect .
Generally it can be noted that the participation of new Member States is stronger in the fields of security , soci@@ o@@ economic research and space , and weaker , for example , in ICT and health .
I believe that in the end we will also have better policies by asking and consulting citizens .
I wonder would the Commission consider - given that we are very close to the election at this point - making sure that there is a dedicated group or number of people within each Member State with a particular telephone number etc. where candidates could immediately access the Commission for information on particular issues like that .
This can be con@@ den@@ sed down very simply into four very clear areas .
This will ensure that those who are near the end of their playing care@@ ers or those who may have other economic issues with regard to them can get further protection from it .
On the other hand , it would also be desirable for the Commission to assess the impact of and need to wi@@ den the scope of this extension to include the audiovisual sector .
( EL ) Commissioner , as we heard during the debate , opinions on the legislative regulation extending the period of protection for intellectual property vary .
This would not only be good for the climate ; it would also reduce the number of road traffic accidents .
Transport is a fundamental problem in urban areas .
Also needed are modal solutions , which use various means of mass transport and reduce con@@ gestion in city centres .
( HU ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
The legal basis needs to be changed and verification procedures need to be simpler and clearer .
Thank you for endor@@ sing it .
We , on the other hand , have come up with proposals and have worked hard to make it easier for people without fat pur@@ ses to be able to travel abroad to receive care .
I look forward to hearing your views .
So this is purely a matter for clarification .
For these reasons , as raised by the managers mentioned above , I voted for the compromise text put to the vote today .
We should also reduce the exchange rate mechanism period to one year for other non @-@ euro zone countries .
We must make a clear distinction between the statements of President Vor@@ on@@ in and the actions of political representatives on the one hand and the interests of Moldo@@ van citizens on the other hand .
I have just returned from Macedonia and Kosovo and should like to address three points .
There are inspiring concepts , such as the cra@@ dle @-@ to @-@ cra@@ dle concept put forward by Michael Bra@@ ung@@ art , radical ideas to make possible a complete re@@ use of materials .
I will now set out what we were trying to achieve . We wanted to clarify the basic concepts and the use of the CE mark , simplify the procedures in order to reduce costs for businesses , especially for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , and to raise the credibility of the entire system .
Emma Bonino , the leader of my political party , was arrested by the Taliban for her mere presence , as a European Commissioner , and was held in detention for some hours precisely because of her presence in defence of women &apos;s rights .
It is in the interests of the democratic credibility of the Iraqi Government , as well as the US Administration , which has granted their status as protected persons , to protect their lives , respect their free will and dignity and guarantee their safe future under international law .
in writing . - The E@@ PL@@ P welcomes Mr Vis@@ ser &apos;s report into tax ev@@ asion linked to import and other cross @-@ border transactions .
Nothing would be worse in this period of major economic crisis than for us to withdraw into ourselves and take refuge in a panic @-@ stri@@ cken fear of others , of foreigners .
It is important for flexibility , for the worker and the employer alike .
Madam President , cases of the cruel slaughter of se@@ als are part of the phenomenon of po@@ aching , which , unfortunately , we encounter fairly often .
Se@@ al hunting occurs in Sweden , but it is controlled protective hunting .
If we take away their live@@ lihood , they will have no chance of economic survival .
I am very pleased that it is possible tonight to reach a first @-@ reading agreement on this highly sensitive file .
- ( CS ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am concerned about the suffering of laboratory animals as well , but at the same time I know , as a physi@@ cian , that we must do everything we can to make vaccines and medicines available to our patients as soon as possible , for the treatment of new and old diseases .
In short , we would like the Commission to take some time in the interven@@ ing election period before Parliament is re@@ constituted in July to undertake the following work ( this is all contained in the O@@ ral Question ) : an analysis of the practical and legal implications of the proposal on consumer rights in each Member State ; a clarification of the relationship between the fully harmonised provisions in the directive and the general reme@@ dies available in national contract law ; a clarification of the inter@@ play of the draft proposal with existing Community legislation , in particular the Un@@ fair Commercial Prac@@ tices Directive , E @-@ Commerce Directive , Services Directive , the Rome I Regulation and , of course , the proposed C@@ FR .
I hope that we will see the next Council Presidency here more often , because we cannot continue to operate in this way .
Today &apos;s task is therefore a difficult one , but it is an opportunity for us to reaffir@@ m our priorities as we reach the end of this parliamentary term .
The arguments put forward by these people have a common denom@@ in@@ ator : concerns about the impact of a massive loss of Member State sovereignty on the everyday life of citizens of EU Member States .
We were pleased that the representative of the European Parliament attended the preparatory workshops - namely Mr Ander@@ sson , chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
You want to renew the social agenda via the Working Time Directive , which has two aims .
Member of the Commission . - The Commission is a full participant in the G20 and is participating fully in this process .
They have also founded a Co@@ ven@@ ant of May@@ ors &apos; Office for coordination and promotion .
I would add , with regard to labelling , that you should recognise that producers of traditional ro@@ sé wine will never agree to calling this con@@ co@@ ction - including the one which Mr Sav@@ ary prepared - &apos; ro@@ sé &apos; .
Do not pen@@ alise real wine growers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , in this debate I think the issue of animal welfare has been narro@@ wed down too much to the question of whether or not we should use stunning .
The vote will take place on Wednesday 6 May 2009 .
The final compromise left us with a bit less money for rural development than we had wanted .
Fel@@ low Members , given that my party is not expected to do well enough in the elections for me to continue working for the next five years among you , I would therefore also like to thank you for the excellent cooperation which I have enjoyed in this House .
They will create proper conditions for greater solidarity between Member States through the diversification of gas supply sources and the actual suppliers .
Our work is complementary .
Within months he had stood down , having performed his function of bringing ridi@@ cu@@ le upon the European Parliament .
How do we get a reliable list of safe countries of origin ?
Each democratically minded person must realise that not even the most aggressive ons@@ lau@@ ghts against politicians who have not signed the Treaty of Lisbon will change anything .
It has thus expressed the will of the Czech people to have the Treaty of Lisbon in place .
At the outset , may I make it quite clear that what I say on this debate tonight is fully predic@@ ated in my next sentence .
The land@@ fill must be re @-@ covered by a final layer in order to prevent the disper@@ sion of fi@@ bres .
Thank you , Mr Sav@@ ary .
You perhaps wonder how we classi@@ fy our amendments : is Amendment X , written in Lat@@ vian , closer to the original Portuguese text than Amendment Y , written in Slovenian ?
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
Form@@ ation of political groups : see Minutes
Two weeks ago the Slovak Parliament adopted a regulation which will seriously restrict the rights of the minorities living in that country to use their own language .
That which has basically created wealth and prosperity would very quickly be lost had we not resi@@ sted the call for protectionism .
Is the Swedish Presidency prepared to contribute to a good international climate agreement by making a greater part of the EU &apos;s cuts in emissions on home soil ?
Moreover , the oli@@ gar@@ chy that has enjoyed power in recent decades is now divided , which will affect the stability of the regime .
Ladies and gentlemen , the events of the last few weeks have openly demonstrated the extremism and radical nature of the current Iranian leaders ; it is clear that the international community cannot afford for them to obtain nuclear weapons .
Only by granting equal rights will China have peaceful internal development and acceptance of this country .
In particular , the Commission must lose no time in stating how it intends to ensure that Germany , too , respects the European competition rules in this dossier .
The first is that , until now , State aid for the car industry and the action taken by the Member States and the Commission have been marked , on the one hand , by what I would call a defensive approach and , on the other , by a short @-@ term approach .
The Council , the European Parliament and the Commission will all need to be persu@@ aded and to cooperate in the creation of this mechanism .
I think it is tremendous that European action forces should help where local fire fighters cannot manage alone .
I would like to stress the disastrous impact that this type of disaster has on the lives of the populations that are affected , on their economies , employment , natural and cultural heritage , the environment and tourism .
We will also secure the protection of European geographical indications , such as Par@@ ma ham , Ri@@ o@@ ja or Tok@@ ay .
The additional resources given to Frontex will never be a substitute for the necessary solidarity that must unite the Member States , enabling them to act together in accommod@@ ating people who need international protection , and in accommod@@ ating a foreign labour force that is needed to meet the democratic challenges of the future .
It must not be the case that the Commission will not rest until the last public c@@ eme@@ tery in Europe is privati@@ sed .
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , the truth is this : if we want to have a Europe that is closer to the citizens , we have to make our choices on the basis of policies .
The situation is clear .
Across the UK , unions are once more in talks over strike action in response to problems associated with the Po@@ sted Workers Directive , with fears of the under@@ cutting of wages and undermining of collective agreements .
Unfortunately I did not get an answer from you ; hopefully I will now .
I am even asking the Japanese Prime Minister why Japan is now carrying out capital punishment again , when there was a moratorium .
This objective will be achieved by adapting to the new conditions of the anti @-@ labour Lisbon Strategy by 2020 and through an even more vi@@ cious attack on the workers &apos; labour , wage , social and insurance rights .
For example , by reducing the consumption of imported oil , not only do you save money , and you do not pay it to the oil @-@ producing countries , but you also reduce CO2 emissions .
The London Summit at the beginning of April insisted , in this respect , on the need to quickly put these plans into practice .
We want a number of the G20 &apos;s elements and commitments to be formali@@ sed .
( SK ) In my opinion , what you have presented here is a rather ambitious plan , which you want to present to the G20 .
The vote will take place during the first October part @-@ session .
Mr President , I am delighted to have the opportunity to present one of the main priorities of the Swedish Presidency - the development of the strategy for the Baltic Sea area .
The high visibility this provides for the strategy is extremely welcome .
Some Members , Mrs Kre@@ hl and Mr I@@ tä@@ l@@ ä , have raised the matter of resources .
Finally , the messages sent out by voters during the European elections , which showed us that they no longer want a weakened , incomprehensible Europe , where compromise is considered a superior virtue to political direction .
I know that that is a matter of concern to many in this House .
Just like you , I have met many frustr@@ ated people - particularly young people - who are unable to travel around Europe as they would like , unable to visit their friends , unable to enjoy the freedoms that we all have .
the oral question to the Commission by Michael Cashman , Claude Mor@@ a@@ es and E@@ mine Bo@@ z@@ kur@@ t , on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , on the Lithu@@ anian Law for the Protection of Min@@ ors against the Det@@ ri@@ mental Eff@@ ects of Public Information - B@@ 7 @-@ 020@@ 7 / 2009 ) .
The law was assessed in vigorous terms by the Lithu@@ anian media , comm@@ ent@@ ators , and civil liberties and human rights defen@@ ders , who stressed its hom@@ opho@@ bic substance along with its extremely dangerous political implications , such as cens@@ orship and self @-@ cens@@ orship .
The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption .
That was a very poor and short @-@ sighted decision .
One relates to the philosophy and markets .
I welcome the progress that has been made through the signing of the agreement in Ankara launching the Nabucco project and the protocol to the agreement for launching the Des@@ er@@ tec project .
In the Czech Republic , for example , 15 Czech da@@ i@@ ries are clin@@ ically dead in financial terms , according to the managing director of Ma@@ de@@ ta , Mr Te@@ pl@@ ý .
This is a dis@@ grace !
This law aims to prevent the dissemination of public information &apos; that ag@@ it@@ ates for homo@@ sexual ... relations &apos; or that &apos; de@@ fies family values &apos; .
The Community Civil Protection Mechan@@ ism is a very visible sign of European solidarity with countries worldwide , and I am convinced that it will continue to grow in strength and effectiveness .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Republic of Taiwan was sha@@ ken to its foundations on 8 August .
That is the solution , not con@@ den@@ sing the whole agenda into Wednesday .
When we talk about the result of this referendum , Mr President , it is , however , about something quite different .
My concern is that the current march towards political union without the support of the peoples of Europe threatens to undermine the good work that the EU has done .
Mr President , I stand here today as a proud Irish MEP .
Inci@@ dentally , it is not unusual to repeat refer@@ enda : that has been done previously on domestic issues , and in certain Member States you can come back several times on a domestic issue too , so let us be intellec@@ tually honest about this whole procedure .
Ireland said &apos; yes &apos; to the Treaty 16 months after its re@@ sounding &apos; no &apos; which generated equal concern among all the governments in Europe .
The Treaty of Lisbon enables the EU to step up Europe &apos;s role in policies on energy , climate change , science and cooperation with developing countries .
Europe is undergoing difficult times , and the reforms proposed by the Lisbon Treaty will give an impetus for a more effective institutional structure which will undoubtedly lead to more coherent policies in many areas .
Exam@@ ples are accredi@@ tation of for@@ en@@ sic laboratories , harmonisation of the policy on interpreters and the transfer of criminal records .
European citizens hope that the area of freedom , security and justice will be a reality in which their procedural rights are equally respected and guaranteed , regardless of the part of Community territory in which they find themselves .
We are using our competences to uphold those rights and freedoms in our work , on the basis of the Treaties , and will continue to do so .
This amounts to a form of additional financing through the courts .
The threat is instability in the region , if these countries remain outside the euro area .
U@@ TV , whose withdrawal from IN@@ N pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated the service &apos;s dem@@ ise , has also been centrally involved in the efforts to source a replacement service .
That is 81 % .
It is just as important for us to be able to make European legislation as accessible as possible to all citizens .
At the same time , I agree that a harmonisation of principles at the Community level will contribute not only towards guaranteeing security of supply , but also towards the stabilisation of an internal market where internal border controls have been removed and towards protecting animals entering the Community .
The Union and the Member States are doing little or nothing to deal with this tragedy .
Already , you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia , Hungary and Romania : lower wages , lower pension benefits , fewer public services and higher VAT .
You will certainly hear voices from the Commission appealing clearly to keep financing for education @-@ related activities and for research and innov@@ atory aid at the highest possible level , even under these very difficult economic constraints .
Re@@ f@@ using to grant funding until the very end of the year is a form of political pressure , and as you yourself know , all the Sla@@ vic peoples have a similar saying : an empty bag cannot stand u@@ pri@@ ght .
However , I remain un@@ convinced by the buy @-@ out scheme .
The Environment Council &apos;s conclusions will also deal with the question of a decision concerning the EU &apos;s proposal in the negotiations on emissions reductions for international aviation and maritime transport , develop the EU &apos;s strategy for measures in developing countries with regard to measurement , reporting and verification of investments and the role of sectoral mechanisms , and will further develop the EU &apos;s strategy to combat de@@ fore@@ station and forest degradation in order to speed up the negotiations .
I am confident that this will continue to be the case in jum@@ ping this final hur@@ dle to seeing the Treaty enter into force after the strong support given to the Lisbon Treaty by the people of Ireland .
However , an un@@ questionable truth ( and I have the evidence here to prove it ) is that the MEP who has tabled this amendment showed his intoler@@ ance and in@@ qui@@ sit@@ orial mind@@ set yesterday on his website , by calling for the writer José Sar@@ am@@ ago , the Nobel Prize @-@ winner for literature , to ren@@ ounce his Portuguese nationality .
It is another example of how some Members of this Chamber are all too eager to make grand gest@@ ures with other people &apos;s money .
I hope that day never comes and I will do my utmost to prevent it .
It is supported in Member States , in national parliaments and , honourable Members - if you look at Eurostat surveys for instance - also by citizens all around the European Union .
We would like to consolidate the TEC &apos;s role as a bilateral forum to address both day @-@ to @-@ day and strategic issues regarding transatlantic trade and investment .
Many of us will be in Washington in the next few days , where we will have the opportunity to hold discussions with our colleagues from Congress .
Commissioner Ashton here will deal with this , and I will certainly convey Parliament &apos;s interest .
We will monitor progress .
As far as we are concerned , we have just launched two project packages , with financing from the European Commission , for strengthening confidence in the health , environmental protection , social and economic sectors .
After verification of the margins , the vote in committee left a margin of EUR 1 7@@ 75 000 in He@@ ading 3@@ b .
The systematic use of torture in prisons and the use of medieval pun@@ ish@@ ments , such as amp@@ utation and st@@ oning , is well known , but the regime is in difficulty as shown by the tens of thousands of people who were brave enough to protest in the streets following the last elections .
Madam , you are supposed to talk on the subject under the catch @-@ the @-@ eye procedure .
It is easier to end a war than to create peace .
Let me explain the situation on the eve of the European Council .
They are spec@@ ul@@ ating in the name of God , to put it bl@@ un@@ tly .
Finally , I hope , of course , that we will continue to cooperate closely on the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Finally , Madam President , I would like to thank Parliament for the interest it is showing in the process of implementing the Services Directive .
Just over half of Member States seem to be in a position to achieve the implementation of the Services Directive by the end of 2009 deadline or in the beginning of 2010 .
The recovery of states from the crisis and their further stabilisation is closely linked with European Union policy in relation to those states .
However , the horse @-@ trading prior to the decision on the free trade agreement with Korea has resulted in us debating this proposal once again , and this is an inappropriate way to deal with this type of proposal .
But I do make my commitment to carry on with this , because there is a strength of feeling .
The manner in which their homes have been sear@@ ched and pos@@ sessions con@@ fis@@ cated , along with the constant , blat@@ ant violation of their rights as de@@ tain@@ ees , totally contra@@ ven@@ es European human rights norms .
The liberalisation of the visa regime is based on a regional strategy and European perspective without discrimin@@ ating against all of the countries of the Western Balkans .
in writing . - I took the decision to support this motion for a resolution as I oppose the suggestion made by the Commission to reduce the financial envel@@ ope of the Programme for Employment and Social solidarity - Progress , by EUR 100 million and to real@@ locate this money to the European Micro@@ finance Facili@@ ty for Employment and Social Inclu@@ sion .
An important challenge for bilateral relations is also the criteria for evaluation of the problem of the observ@@ ance of human rights and the principles of the rule of law in Russia .
I am already aware that Parliament , to which this package means a great deal , will make sure that the transposition is undertaken with respect for past agreements .
Mr President , to continue in the same v@@ ein , I would like to take the floor as coordinator for the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance on matters concerning freedom , which is precisely my point .
In yesterday &apos;s Financial Times , there were reports about how European businesses - including very important corporations in the European Union - are gaining from going green and actually fore@@ see , by 2020 , that their green business will sur@@ pass all the other business .
We have to take on board the arguments of the scep@@ tics and we have to challenge them .
She took a shower .
What I am asking for is for Europe not to be nai@@ ve but to be a realistic and firm negoti@@ ator with those of its partners that have not made significant efforts to reduce their emissions .
First these were portra@@ yed as being narro@@ w@@ ly restricted to the field of cross @-@ border counter @-@ terrorist activities .
On the other hand , both the environmental effects and the safety of the technologies used in storage must be thoroughly investigated .
Carbon capture and storage can make a significant contribution to efforts aimed at tackling global warming and my own country , Scotland , will play an important role in developing the necessary technology .
Generally speaking , the Commission and Parliament share the same will when it comes to combating all forms of discrimination and to promoting equality between men and women .
Let me tell you what your common legal system has done for the life of one person .
That is why we have very many discussions .
Firstly , two Members , one of whom was Mr B@@ atten , mentioned specific examples of how citizens are affected - perhaps in another country - and it is their opinion that conditions are not very good .
We also need to invest in development cooperation in the form of aid .
The Stockholm Programme will convert this into political priorities to give substance to the specific action plans envisaged for the coming years .
The moment that the Commission supported the creation , in Poland , of a factory of the same company focused on producing laptop computers , was the moment - because the market is made that way and because there is a much higher demand for laptop computers - that sign@@ alled the collapse of the Irish production plant .
Since , in the case of Dell , we can clearly see that there is a danger of the procedure being distorted and of misuse of Community funds and of the author@@ is@@ ations granted within the context of competition policy .
The EU must not support financially the strategy of companies which re@@ locate and make workers redundant , especially if the company moves outside the EU or receives aid from another Member State at the same time .
The state of play of the Euro@@ med Free Trade Area ( debate )
Firstly , I would like us all to be clear about something : if the aim of the free trade area was indeed to benefit all of the partners , from the North and from the South , setting 2010 as the date on which it will be introduced was neither realistic nor even desirable , given that there are still huge disparities in development terms between the north and the south sides of the Mediterranean .
I would like to begin by focusing on the essence of the multi@@ lingu@@ alism policy which we have wanted to promote during this period .
I voted in favour of granting financial discharge to the Council for the 2007 budget whilst emphasi@@ sing the fact that I disagree with the way in which the Committee on Budgetary Control has managed this situation in which the rapporteur , Mr S@@ ø@@ n@@ der@@ ga@@ ard , has produced two contradictory reports ; the change in position between the proposals for postp@@ oning discharge in April 2009 and for granting discharge being justified by the asser@@ tions resulting from meetings without any audit work , whilst the European Court of Auditors has made no comment on the management of the Council .
It has proven its de@@ vo@@ tion to the re@@ ac@@ tionary policy of the EU , its support for the interests of the monopolies , its role as the body which gives allegedly legal cre@@ dence to the anti @-@ grass@@ roots policy of the EU .
Only then will it be possible to reduce distortions in international competition .
With the introduction of a &apos; made in Europe &apos; concept , we could enable consumers to make an informed choice , to take action to gain new rights .
I want us to differenti@@ ate between these three situations because the western Balkans , Iceland and Turkey present three different scenarios from an integration perspective .
Arti@@ ficial obstacles have been put in its way and I am grateful to the Swedish Presidency for helping to remove them .
In fact , violence by men costs more women &apos;s lives than malaria , traffic accidents , terrorism and war combined .
Secondly , it is highly questionable to launch a European Security and Defence Policy ( ES@@ DP ) training mission which has not been properly justified and which will not make a demon@@ stra@@ ble contribution to state @-@ building in Somalia .
Commissioner , how much progress has been made in implementing the G8 commitments made in July ?
He is not a socialist , my predecessor , he is a communist ; I mean you should look at his political group : he is a communist and that probably explains the reasoning he was using .
Thirdly , it will aim at providing the basis for the whole EU approach to harmonise existing EC@@ MS policy frameworks following the commitments set out in the L &apos;@@ Aqu@@ ila agenda for action .
There is no faith that the new measures implemented recently are actually being taken stock of .
Me@@ at products can carry a particularly wide range of health risks if they are not produced in the appropriate conditions .
The European Parliament has , in the past , strongly supported the Commission &apos;s efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance .
Turkey has to implement speedy reforms and changes if it is to be ready to join the European Union , although I do not myself share the belief that that will happen in our lifetime .
Romania currently has approximately 1 600 hectares of tobacco plant@@ ations providing a production of roughly 3 000 tonnes .
The People &apos;s Republic of China is the country which carries out the most exec@@ utions in the world .
Moreover , for agriculture in the most remote regions , the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying .
In the meantime , however , the negotiations have failed twice .
It was supposed to be a round to promote development , a round allowing developing countries to correct the imbalances created by the liberal policies implemented to date within the framework of the not@@ orious Washington Con@@ sensus .
It is urgent and essential for us to embark on a path of moderate protectionism , which is reasonable , socially just and equ@@ itable , representing a mutually advantageous cooperation for different peoples and continents .
The issue of funding is more serious .
The countries of the European Union are experiencing the crisis now ; Europe needs new jobs now ; support for new entrepreneurship initiatives is needed right away .
I would like to applaud the great professionalism of the Swedish Presidency .
Greece will , of course , go on benefiting from cohesion funds as it is one of the countries benefiting from those cohesion funds , and this is separate from the European Union 2020 Strategy .
I believe we all agree with the overall and over@@ riding priority of a resu@@ mption of Israeli @-@ Palestinian negotiations - not negotiations for negotiations &apos; sake , but negotiations to achieve a peace deal and turn the page .
Therefore , the question I would like to put to Mrs Ashton is as follows : should we , as Parliament , be given information about what I think is a very important matter - about various restrictions on the application of certain laws ?
This is contained in Article 15 ( 3 ) of the Treaty of Lisbon .
You only need to think about the agreement with the US on SWIFT .
In this regard , the talks in Geneva are extremely important , even though they will be difficult .
We are lec@@ turing President Sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i on the changes which he has to introduce in his country .
Fel@@ low Members , if you think Russian tanks have , at any time in history , brought democracy to anyone , you are pro@@ found@@ ly mistaken .
We must say &apos; no &apos; to this , because then we will be able to be credible in what we say to all other countries , including Georgia , about democracy .
The economic and financial crisis has had a much har@@ sher effect on the transforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe than on the stable democracies of Western Europe .
We must aim for budget deficits that are not only within the 3 % GDP limit , but also do our utmost to achieve balanced budgets .
Still , we know that if we keep on using the world &apos;s resources the way we do , our current way of life will no longer be an option and we will face even more drastic changes .
Now it is up to the European Parliament to agree to the final steps .
Neither should anyone expect to get good marks from Mr Bor@@ gh@@ e@@ zio .
Concerning the Copenhagen Summit , I fully endorse the position stated by Mr Barroso .
In proposing these solutions , we are also pointing out that the European Union must give priority to its political objectives , and not just focus on trade objectives .
Nevertheless , over the last 30 years a considerable amount has been achieved , although much more still lies ahead to be done .
This represents an opportunity to agree on a new agenda and a new conc@@ ord between the Afghan Government and the international community .
We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and , above all , towards a more people @-@ cent@@ red strategy .
We believe that this is important and that it must define our partnership in the future .
There seems to be a great shortage of specialised professions , which has resulted in a trade in these qualifications and led to genuine qualifications being dis@@ regarded .
This is why we need a strong and adequately funded cohesion policy .
The involvement of the regional and local levels of governance must definitely grow , but without these regions necessarily feeling that they are gradually being forgotten and abandoned .
This is good for the circulation .
The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country .
Now I believe that the Bureau , or , rather , the Conference of Presidents , should not have gone against a precise and timely decision by the House , and I therefore think that the House should express its views on this point shortly .
The decision has been made to extend the restrictions on access to domestic labour markets , in spite of the recommendations made by the European Commission , which indicate that the mobility of Eastern European workers has not up@@ set labour markets and has actually generated economic growth .
Given that the living standards in both countries are very low , I can only imagine that this will have a significant impact on the more developed Member States .
However , we should applaud the engagement of various international actors , ranging from governments to civil society organisations and to individuals worldwide .
We had work done , with the Council and Commission side coming together for the very first time , and may I just say , it is only eight days since I was before you in my hearing here .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , the European Parliament has paid close attention to the internal and foreign policy developments in Iran .
Today I also appeal for international attention to address efforts to free the British engineer , Anthony S. , and five other European host@@ ages , who worked at a local hospital in Yemen and who remain kidn@@ apped since last June .
Mrs Gi@@ ann@@ ak@@ ou raised the question of d@@ wind@@ ling water and d@@ wind@@ ling oil ; I think Yemen is the first country that is expected to run out of water by about 2015 , something which we have to see as a real and significant challenge .
She says that eight times what we put into those countries goes out .
Str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening the power of the J@@ PA and of the national parliaments will automatically lead to better democratic scrutiny and , above all , to far greater transparency .
This situation calls for international solidarity , action and attention .
This was the case in Z@@ ambi@@ a , where very substantial investments - to the tune of USD 46 million , I believe - were made in the M@@ op@@ ani mine , for example .
In order to prevent and eliminate these phenomena effectively , it is essential that in particular EU Member States , professional enforcement agencies exist which ideally would be centrali@@ sed , and would guarantee decisive and effective action as well as good international cooperation .
What Europe needs is to adopt some aspects of the Spanish model .
I wish to finish , however , by congratulating you and giving you my support on one particular matter , that of equality between men and women .
I welcome the fact that the Presidency is concerned with developing the European Research Area and ensuring mobility for researchers .
It will , of course , promote , encourage and demand all countries to push forward with the necessary agreements for fiscal transparency and for the provision of information in the context of the international community .
I am glad to hear about the &apos; Innov@@ ating Europe &apos; programme introduced by the Spanish Presidency , because it has set the acceler@@ ation of developing a policy on tourism as a priority , including giving consideration to the view@@ points of tourists regarding the EU policies related to the industry .
That is a disappointing outcome , particularly as we know that every year that we lose will , of course , result in us having to raise our efforts even further .
Secondly , I was rather delighted to learn at the hearings that Commissioner Taj@@ ani has not ruled out the undertaking of an impact study on the possibility of imposing this carbon tax at the borders of the European Union .
We cannot &apos; half @-@ commit &apos; to investment in renewable energy sources and low @-@ carbon transport .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2007 that they would disappear by the year 20@@ 35 .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first of all , let me thank you for a very substantive and responsible debate .
It is time for the EU to review its policy and end this fan@@ tasi@@ sing .
I think that is the place and the forum .
Madam President , I join those who said that a democratic opening has enabled the kind of progress we have not seen in some years and generated development where , some years ago , we thought this would be impossible .
In addition , a party system that results in better representation of the Turkish population must be introduced .
In parallel , the countries of the Danube Region have each nominated a national contact point , and the first meeting of these contact points has been held with the Member States .
These three pillars will include a number of concrete actions based on the contributions received from the Member States , stakeholders and from within the Commission .
In Hungary , in the area between the Danube and the T@@ is@@ za rivers , the sandy plain is actually experiencing serious deser@@ ti@@ fication .
The Danube must remain a symbol for future generations , too .
Furthermore , it has always played a constructive role towards regional integration in the Maghreb .
This looks positively enligh@@ tened when compared to the &apos; first past the post &apos; electoral system used in the United Kingdom which , in my opinion , is a con@@ spi@@ racy against the vot@@ er to keep the Conservative and Labour parties in and everybody else out .
A free debate is perhaps the most powerful medicine against extremism and violence .
in writing . - ( DE ) The strategy for the Danube Region represents a reasonable model for coordinating EU measures for this con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous region .
This is a further economic burden which the working people of Ireland will not accept .
Tax fraud tar@@ nis@@ hes the entire economy , and has serious implications for national budgets , as it reduces capacity to inc@@ ur expenditure and undertake investment .
Firstly , the area of application is extended , the implementation of automatic information exchange is strengthened , and regarding banking secrecy , it is proposed extending the applic@@ ability criterion to bring it into line with the rest of the directive .
When it is an issue of protecting bank and financial data , the good suddenly turns into the evil .
Back then , when the tax rate was 62 % , my tax adv@@ iser was Christoph Mat@@ z@@ net@@ ter , who later became Austria &apos;s Secretary of State for Finance .
First , we should welcome the fact that the text acknowledges the considerable limits of the fight against tax ha@@ vens as it has been carried out until now .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr T@@ arab@@ ella for his excellent report on equality between women and men in the European Union .
The European Union needs social regulation .
Solidarity , where is it ?
It will fall to pieces , and , as far as the peoples of Europe are concerned , the sooner it does the better .
This is an exceptionally rare decision , since the Court over@@ turned a lower court ruling and decided the case itself , which happens very rarely with the French Court of C@@ ass@@ ation .
It is of symbolic importance that on 15 December last year , during the height of efforts to form the new Commission , 500 000 European citizens from 17 countries requested , in a collective petition , that our institutions interpret and implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in every decision , on the basis of the equal dignity of every human being .
I propose that the ECB , whilst not having any power over budgets or capital @-@ raising , can have an input over the debt maturity profile if it felt that a Member State is over exposed through short @-@ term market movements .
This is what we must focus our attention on .
Firstly - and this is neither dis@@ gra@@ ceful nor depl@@ orable , Mr Sch@@ olz - the security risk for the host country needs to be clarified .
The point has already been made that the fight against corruption is an important element .
2009 was a good year for the candidate country of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FY@@ ROM ) .
For that process to take place with mutual understanding , it must be assured a high level of quality .
Acc@@ ession is and must be the ultimate objective .
In Turkey , we still have a problem with the obstacles faced by religious communities concerning their legal status .
However , are these actions enough to create the necessary grass@@ roots public support for the immediate and successful implementation of the necessary reforms ?
If I succeed in helping one person , I will be helping the greatest possible unit : one person &apos;s entire world .
The patri@@ arch@@ y still completely per@@ v@@ ades our societies .
These are in@@ ali@@ enable values of the project of European integration , and they represent an opportunity for the Turkish people and the peaceful enhan@@ cement of their ethnic and cultural diversity .
We know that the threat of terrorism in some of our Member States remains as high as ever , and I am sure that you can see that rejection of the interim agreement by this House would represent a serious blow to EU security .
The first is to step up the exchange of information , particularly in relation to the efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and research into funding mechanisms .
( FR ) Mr President , we all want to combat terrorism and the threat that it poses to democracies ; there is , I believe , agreement on that point within our Parliament . While the ad@@ age that &apos; a people that is ready to sacrifice a little freedom for a little security ends up losing both &apos; seems completely over the top to me , I am nevertheless convinced that we must do everything we can to find a balance between freedom and security , because this is the foundation of democracy and because , without that balance , the terrorists will have won if they succeed in terror@@ ising us all .
in writing . - Ukraine continues to be crucial for the stability and democratic development of Europe .
There are , really , more important matters , and it is true , as Mr L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z Gar@@ ri@@ do said , that it is the Member States which are obliged to monitor human rights .
Where is the definition of the industrial choices , the agricultural choices , the economic choices and , of course , the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe , so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world ?
Such a large trade deficit and a consumption that exceeds production to such an extent are not sustainable .
There is therefore a window of opportunity through which the Union can impose its policy and effectively reduce obstacles to our exports in rapidly emerging economies and limit social and environmental dumping .
It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not ; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries .
I hope that this very difficult and polar@@ ised situation will be taken into account in the creation of a new regulatory framework and that the Commission will incorporate these key issues that I have raised .
I can promise on behalf of both the committee and myself that I will monitor the launch and subsequent operation of the programme .
This does not aug@@ ur well , in particular in the context of the continued protests following the closure of a broadcast@@ er critical of the government , in which students and opposition members have time and again clas@@ hed viol@@ ently with the security forces .
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma .
It is true that there has been some change .
( The sitting was closed at 16.@@ 25 )
One option is limited change - the lowest common denom@@ in@@ ator which brings some reform and some growth .
There are still many issues : when I think about completing the single market , about the quality of our taxation systems , about the way we spend money at a time of intense pressure on public finances , to name but a few .
Today , we received contradictory information .
Only competitive business and successful entrepreneurs can do that .
The Seventh and Ei@@ gh@@ th Framework Program@@ mes must concentrate on research and development relating to renewable energy .
Secondly , we will need to invest heavily in innovation , research and training , particularly if we want to move towards a green economy .
Secondly , do we have an answer to the debt crisis in the countries that are under the most pressure ?
We talked much today about Greece and I would like to assure you that there was consensus that the euro area Member States would take determined and coordinated action if needed to safeguard financial stability in the euro area .
I therefore believe that we really have fra@@ med and defined very clearly the aspect of responsibility .
We wonder when we read that it is these countries , which do not exactly set an example where human rights are concerned , that are calling for Israel and Hamas to carry out in @-@ depth investigations into the human rights violations committed during &apos; Operation C@@ ast Le@@ ad &apos; .
We Europeans must also say today , especially to Gaza : let us stay human !
We are on our way , with the goal firmly in view .
For Roma women , life expec@@ tancy can be up to 10 years less than those of the majority .
Madam President , Mrs V@@ ă@@ lean , honourable Members , the gas crisis at the beginning of last year showed us how important it is for Europe to have an energy infrastructure in place that not only promotes the functioning of the internal market , but that also enables solidarity between the Member States and the regions affected in the event of a crisis .
As part of Community energy policy , the Commission and the Member States should identify investments which are necessary to meet the EU &apos;s strategic needs in terms of the supply and demand of natural gas and electricity .
I certainly do not .
Two investig@@ ators from the agency joined the Belgian team in charge of the investigation just a few hours after the accident occurred .
I must say that the Ukrainian people passed the ex@@ am .
We therefore feel that for the EU to &apos; become a party to the Convention &apos; as a whole is unnecessary and we oppose the EU acting in this State @-@ like way .
They would rather blame one alcoholic product for an increase in anti@@ social behaviour than accept that their social policies have failed .
The Commission declared 2010 European Year for Com@@ b@@ ating Poverty and Social Exclu@@ sion .
Just very recently , the spokes@@ man for the Copenhagen police made some racist and xen@@ opho@@ bic statements against Roman@@ ians , while the Danish press is br@@ anding a whole nation for the crime apparently committed by a Romanian immigrant .
What we all want in this House is high animal and human health standards , and this new legislation that you promise should ensure that .
The mass transport of animals across the EU , including in Austria , could also allow dangerous diseases to re@@ occur .
Nowadays , a majority of EU citizens organise their holidays themselves rather than purchasing pre@@ defined packages .
This means that the current legislation may not be up to date .
I cannot believe that .
None of them demonstrates a desire to be politically ambitious on a subject that , nevertheless , seems to me to be very important .
Maybe you could give us a time @-@ scale on when we will hear what your opinion is .
There are currently twenty million environmental refugees .
However , EU directives make it difficult for micro @-@ enterprises to operate successfully .
This ought to be the first step forward .
There is currently a transposition deficit which , precisely as you said , is at its lowest ever level .
Mr President , Commissioner Barnier , Commissioner D@@ all@@ i , ladies and gentlemen , today we are talking about the internal market , consumer protection and the mobility of people within the European Union .
However , the treaty does provide a legal basis for the Union to support and complement their efforts .
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the two initial proposals were merged together and a new legal basis was provided .
Above all , he has done so on time and in this matter time is crucial , given that we are dealing with the lives of individuals .
The agreements currently in force have ent@@ ailed numerous disadvantages for third @-@ country nationals who are legally resident in one of the Member States and who wish to travel for various reasons throughout the European Union .
It has already been some time since the number of workers made redundant as a result of the so @-@ called &apos; restruc@@ tur@@ ings &apos; significantly exceeded the initial estimates of the Commission regarding the number of workers who would come to benefit from the fund .
In my opinion , the most problematic issue is the enfor@@ ce@@ ability of legislation and of contractual obligations .
Rap@@ porteur , ladies and gentlemen , I support this initiative and agree entirely with the strengthening of the SOL@@ VIT network and the broad@@ ening of its activities .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party , to which I belong , has always defended the principle of the freedom of movement of individuals , following the principle that rules and common procedures regarding visas , residence permits and the control of borders must form part of the full Schengen concept .
As a result of a problem with the voting machine , my intended vote was not recorded .
This does , of course , raise some concerns but we should try to find , if possible , a harmonised position regarding the utilisation of any security device at European airports .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , my political group .
( MT ) The treaty lays down principles for the protection of fundamental human rights , and those countries wishing to become European Union members must ensure compliance with the European Union &apos;s requirements , as Malta did , and as did all the other countries who became members at the same time .
I am very much looking forward to this evaluation because the evaluation will bring us the information about what we have done well and where the deficiencies are so that we can build on this in order to go ahead with a very targeted action afterwards .
The changes in the regional development funds are important .
I have many questions here , but not this one .
If you now claim that the concerns of my group are un@@ founded , then prove it .
This Parliament will no longer permit back @-@ room debates and decisions .
A moment to see the big picture , to be creative and take collective responsibility .
The real driving force behind the EU &apos;s foreign policy will be the Commission ; Member States and the Council will be continually margin@@ alised .
Naturally , the delegation to the European Parliament of the Job@@ bik Movement for a Better Hungary voted in support of the European Parliament &apos;s resolution on the acceptance and implementation of the Gold@@ stone recommendations and , at the same time , we apologise to the Palestinian victims because the Hungarian Government , shame@@ fully and in diam@@ etri@@ cal opposition to Hungarian popular opinion , continually adop@@ ts a position contrary to the Gold@@ stone report in international for@@ a .
I was pleased to hear the results of today &apos;s vote .
The resolution on AC@@ TA , which has been adopted today and of which I am one of the initi@@ ators , is extremely symbolic because it is unanimous .
On the other hand , copying that is carried out exclusively for one &apos;s own needs should be left out .
According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre , Arctic summer ice has increased by 4@@ 09 000 square miles , or 26 % , since 2007 .
But the hand@@ over of power from F@@ ide@@ l Castro to his brother , Ra@@ ú@@ l , has led neither to democratic reforms , nor to the release of political prisoners .
Can the Presidency elaborate on what exactly its plans are in this area and when we can expect such initiatives to be put in place ?
I do not wish to abuse this position , because I am sure I would be criticised for using this platform to defend the actions of a particular Member State or of a central or regional government of a specific country .
Thirdly , given the scale of medium @-@ term public @-@ private financing needed in order to support major demonstration projects in particular , it may be necessary to increase the proportion of public investment at EU level .
These are the essential elements for the application , which has to reach the Commission within 10 weeks of the disaster .
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice @-@ President of the Commission , C@@ athy Ashton , called Chile &apos;s Foreign Minister , Mari@@ ano Fern@@ ández , the same day to express our con@@ dol@@ ences to the families of the victims and indicate our readiness to provide assistance and support .
It alone will be able to provide vital additional aid in the context of a disaster such as this .
Tra@@ ge@@ dies such as the one which has be@@ fallen Cuban dis@@ sident Orlando Zap@@ ata Tam@@ ay@@ o , &apos; guilty &apos; of a crime of conscience , must never be repeated .
The role of the EU is vitally important , as it has mechanisms and instruments at its disposal , such as the Solidarity Fund , the Structural Funds - the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund - and the Cohesion Fund , which need to be activated and applied in a quick , flexible and simplified manner .
To address this situation , the Government of President Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ ón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication : he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces , a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested , the destruction of drugs and the con@@ fis@@ cation of weapons .
Such fiscal effort is in line with the course of action recommended by the Commission and the Council , as acknowledged by the Council on 16 March .
That is why I am in favour of a strong Commission that will be able , in future , to see that the criteria are met .
Indeed , how can they think of w@@ aging this battle against Chancellor Merkel ?
Secondly , that it should provide for cooperation between the European authorities and the national authorities , because , in my opinion , the national authorities must play an important role in the way signatures are organised .
Mr President , as somebody who has campaign@@ ed twice for a &apos; yes &apos; vote to Lisbon and promoted the citizens &apos; initiative as positive , I disagree with my colleague .
It is clear that there are different systems for the verification of signatures in the Member States .
Transpar@@ ency of procedures is also important .
There is , however , another ir@@ regular situation , because the Slovak national law on which the registration is based does not exist , since Slovakia has repe@@ aled it .
We also need to be able to make our own organisation more efficient and to try to make savings where possible in order , by doing so , to also be able to finance any additional needs .
I will , of course , gladly repeat this all again , and again , and again , throughout the spring and until the autumn , but , nevertheless , I would be very happy if some of the proposals which have already been raised , here , were now included in the draft from the European Commission , so that it will , after all , be necessary to repeat less .
Finally , we must take into account the imbalances produced in the marketing chain , the importance of relying on sectoral marketing standards and the need to draw up EU guidelines for best practice for the operation of the systems related to agricultural product quality and their mutual recognition .
Is the aim simply to reflect compliance with the basic standards that all European farmers meet and that imported goods also meet ?
This is a consequence of the financial and economic crisis which they facilit@@ ated by dereg@@ ul@@ ating financial and trade markets , and pushing through free trade agreements with third countries , without he@@ eding the interests of workers or the public .
It has become apparent that the European economic environment as a whole may be diverse and extensively regulated but , compared to competing economies , it is very cum@@ ber@@ some .
He is currently Under@@ secretary of State at the Ministry of Regional Development .
This applies not only to milk production , but also to wine growing in particular .
We will pursue internal work as well .
But we have the right spr@@ ing@@ board .
I personally , and President Barroso - I say this out of kin@@ dness - even more so than I , have fought to include these five objectives in the European Union &apos;s programme and to keep them there .
It is quite likely that most of the MEPs from the UK will not be present .
The fun@@ er@@ al of the President and his wife was held yesterday .
However , we expect swift , pragmatic solutions on alternative transport systems by land and sea .
In response to our hum@@ orous question of whether he had sle@@ pt through his own speech , Mr Martin adopted a particular stance here , cli@@ cked his he@@ els and gave the Hitler s@@ alu@@ te .
I believe that it is a splendid project that will be making Europe &apos;s diverse cultural heritage available to the people of Europe and throughout the world in a digital online library .
European funds in the form of grants made to individual cultural institutions in Member States should encourage them to be more effective in the digi@@ ti@@ sation of collections .
The alternative thresh@@ olds , however , must lead to the conclusion that an area in question is affected by a significant handic@@ ap , as desired by the Council .
In fact , this debate means that you clearly have the refle@@ xes to act immediately , as is fitting for the House that represents the peoples of Europe , and that you can consider on a longer @-@ term basis what action needs to be taken in response to this entirely un@@ foreseen , completely new crisis , which has had extraordinary and extremely serious effects on the lives of European citizens .
In addition , we have to work with a realistic approach that takes into account dust partic@@ le concentration .
However , I assume that the airlines and the other companies affected will make it possible for the passengers to insist on the rights that still remain to them .
Fortunately , Europe has few natural disasters .
They are also asking why it was not possible to get to Kra@@ kow by road or rail on Sunday , but it was possible to get to Strasbourg by these means on Monday .
This is the logical consequence of the fact that the Commission is deeply involved , and has been since the beginning , in the search for a solution to the financial problems encountered by Greece and in preserving stability within the euro area .
Another key priority for the Commission is to pursue the international development agenda and propose an EU action plan in the run @-@ up to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals summit .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Europe &apos;s regions will only be able to achieve sustainable , integrated growth through a cohesion policy that has visible results and which respects the principle of subsidiarity , and through governance at various levels : national , regional and local .
They are the guarantee that , if the process is well organised , it will be successful .
The region is characterised by a high level of poverty and this agreement must contribute to the economic progress of the people there .
It is important for Mr Salaf@@ ran@@ ca &apos;s report to promote the increase in dialogue in order to identify the methods for achieving the Millennium Development Goals .
We should remember that we have a key dialogue with this region .
The European Union &apos;s active participation should be based , princip@@ ally , on building the foundations of a democratic country , and also on ensuring internal security .
It seems to me particularly crucial to include the Internet in any discussions on the enforcement of intellectual property rights , because it is impossible to protect intellectual property on the Internet without cross @-@ border agreements .
I know that it is looking at that and that the discussions and the rounds so far have been extremely positive and constructive and things are moving at a good pace .
I hope that this report will be only a first step .
I think that the current situation shows us that this intervention has been successful , because prices have stabili@@ sed .
We need supplementary measures , more flexible and effective measures , measures that guarantee market stability in times of crisis .
the report by Mrs Math@@ ie@@ u , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2008 ( SEC ( 2009 ) 10@@ 89 - C@@ 7 @-@ 0@@ 19@@ 1 / 2009 - ,
We have managed to reduce , com@@ post or re@@ use 50 % of our waste streams .
Until now , the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de si@@ ege with the EC@@ DC , although they desperately wanted this agency , like all Member States always badly want an agency .
There have been one or two speeches - Mr S@@ ø@@ n@@ der@@ ga@@ ard &apos;s , for example - that have mentioned transparency , lack of transparency or not enough transparency .
It is in this context that we must come together to review all these discharge procedures on the cost of control .
However , there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union , namely Co@@ unter Balance , which has attacked the European Investment Bank .
I think that these two weeks , which are available to us because of the postp@@ on@@ ement of the vote due to the problems with flying , present us with an opportunity ; an opportunity to find solutions to the outstanding problems and to find answers to those questions and reservations raised by Parliament to which we have not yet found re@@ assuring answers .
The retention period for data is set at around five years , because it is obviously necessary to retain the data for a minimum period of time for reasons of effectiveness .
We have seen the draft resolution and that is signed by four political groups .
For practical reasons , it was not possible to do this before September 2009 .
This directive , which aims at establishing a common system of invo@@ icing with regard to value added tax , is therefore essential for achieving those aims .
Therefore , they must objec@@ tively and rigor@@ ously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used .
The Commission has put forward a communication on strategic goals and recommendations for the EU &apos;s maritime transport policy until 20@@ 18 .
Every year more than 400 million passengers use European ports , and therefore maritime transport directly affects the quality of European citizens &apos; lives .
I would not under any circumstances be able to support a future proposal that prevented Member States from producing better mandatory standards for animal welfare than the standards that we are able to agree on at EU level .
I note with satisfaction the fact that the E@@ ES@@ C has adopted the practice of including a chapter in its annual activity report describing how the previous discharge decisions of Parliament and the Court of Auditors were followed up .
While the other European institutions are doing their duty , the European Parliament resi@@ sts forming a relationship with this great country except through Mercosur , making it the only one out of Brazil , Russia , India and China ( BR@@ IC ) in which the European Union does not maintain a separate parliamentary delegation .
The green highlights in the middle of a disappointing report are : the paragraph concerning the ruling by the Inter @-@ American Court of Human Rights on fem@@ ini@@ cides ( the case of Campo Al@@ go@@ don@@ ero in Mexico ) was kept in the text , with 3@@ 59 votes in favour , 235 against and 17 ab@@ sten@@ tions ; we succeeded in getting into the text that the European investment facility should in particular be used for projects contributing to combating climate change , such as local public transport , electric vehicles and the Y@@ as@@ uni @-@ IT@@ T project in Ecuador ( &apos; Keep the oil underground &apos; ) .
For example , in January 2000 , more than 100 000 cu@@ bic metres of cy@@ an@@ ide @-@ contaminated water escap@@ ed from a gold mine in Romania and poll@@ uted the rivers and streams of Romania , Hungary , Serbia and Bulgaria .
This principle applies to mining technology as well .
No , we instruc@@ ted them to hold elections , and that is what should be done in the case of new Members .
This includes binding decision @-@ making powers to deal with genuine emer@@ gencies , to enforce European rules - and I insist on European rules , not only national rules - and to settle any disputes within the col@@ leges of national super@@ vis@@ ors .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are held cap@@ tive by the theory of the ever closer union .
Year after year you have looked on , year after year you have approved this , and now we , the citizens , are having to pay the price .
For heaven &apos;s sake why are we talking about these other targets when we are not actually moving on what we have already ?
In my opinion , the matter of rail transport should be tackled decisively and quickly .
How can IC@@ T@@ s make this major contribution to transforming our economy ?
OLAF is willing to cooperate still more closely with the I@@ AS .
Commissioner , I would like you to support this idea .
Small enterprises are , of course , the engine of our economy .
However , it is important to ensure that the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople in question actually receive the loans .
The economic crisis in Ukraine is not just a crisis for Ukraine , but is also a matter for all of us .
I would like to raise two points in my speech . First of all , I would like to start with a point made by an inhabit@@ ant of Nigeria who was asked what the cause of the evil in this country was .
( Applause )
As you said , listen and talk to each other .
in writing . - I voted against this report because of our main amendment , in which we claimed that Members of the European Parliament should be elected by direct universal suff@@ rage .
Currently , one in three Europeans is diagno@@ sed with cancer , and one in four Europeans dies from this disease .
Nonetheless , we know that progress is slow in har@@ ness@@ ing the potential of energy efficiency and energy savings , not only because existing economic interest groups are looking after their own interests , but also because of the low level of aid for the necessary changes .
I voted for the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the mass atro@@ cities in J@@ os , Nigeria .
By the same token , I repeat my proposal to create a European credit rating authority .
In the European Union today , there is insufficient protection for self @-@ employed women who are mothers , and there are insufficient improvements in the situation of sp@@ ouses of self @-@ employed people .
It is regrettable , however , that the Council did not agree to compulsory membership , but simply adopted the system of voluntary membership .
Allow me to reiterate and highlight the main points of my report .
It is now a matter of how this plan is implemented .
What has caused , and continues to cause , us concern is the failure to meet the deadlines for implementing SIS II .
Unfortunately , there was no consensus on this position at the last tri@@ alogue .
7 . The establishment of a joint EU res@@ ett@@ lement programme (
A future for Europe - which is what I want to talk about - means , above all , future generations .
It pul@@ ls the w@@ ool over people &apos;s eyes .
This will make work easier both for administrative bodies and for businesses , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which will find it easier to participate in ten@@ ders .
Low resistance is important in heat ex@@ chan@@ gers , while high resistance is important because of the low thermal conduc@@ tivity of insul@@ ating materials .
The objectives are clear and defined , and are connected with areas as important as the creation of more employment opportunities or encouraging young people to play a more active part in society .
The common agricultural policy is an essential element of the European Union , whether we are talking about providing food for our citizens or about con@@ serving and protecting mountain regions and rural areas , as well as the outermost or disadvantaged regions .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks go to Mr Mi@@ kol@@ á@@ š@@ ik and Mr Per@@ ello Ro@@ dri@@ gu@@ ez for their quite excellent work .
We really are waiting for it .
How were these Christmas tree wishes treated before the Lisbon Treaty ?
There are many elements in this report , which say where we have to move .
I therefore consider it crucial to pursue the courses of action undertaken , and ensure that the principles and recommended courses of action are implemented at both European and national levels .
I am pleased to hear today that there will soon be decisions on the creation of the Single European Sky and that , according to the Commissioner , an airspace coordinator already began work in May .
This will lead to job losses in the airline sector and consequently , less competition in the market .
However , everyone can see that this is not about bre@@ aching democracy or parliamentary sovereignty but ensuring that our Member States respect those very same rules which they have themselves decided on previously : in other words , to practice what you pre@@ ach .
Even in good times , the German Government of Mr Schröder went through the 3 % ceiling , and Greece , of course , broke all the records , because the Greek political class is utterly unable to manage money .
What did Mr Prodi say about the Stability Pact in 2002 ?
The next step , which is surely more difficult to implement , should be to strive for a measured change to our workforce structure .
The Greek nation , Prime Minister and politicians now deserve our respect , since they are taking some very difficult decisions .
None of the Member States is able to mount effective resistance to global threats on its own .
That is why I voted as I did .
However , I do not think that th@@ rom@@ bin &apos; meat glu@@ e &apos; complies with this requirement .
At the same time , we will also achieve closer cooperation between the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Court of Human Rights and national courts .
This could be our chance to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of EU citizens .
Ear@@ marking is among the instruments that have been effective and have also definitely influenced the agenda in the regions , towns and cities .
I am very happy to share this debate with all these European Parliament initiatives , but I do feel as though I am in a mel@@ ting pot which I am not sure offers an exact definition of the European Parliament &apos;s vision for the EU 2020 strategy .
( FI ) Mr President , when I was studying at the University of Helsinki in the 1980s , the Soviet Union was still going strong .
An even more accurate title would have been the &apos; Stability for Growth Pact &apos; .
The Commission will continue to watch this issue carefully .
In addition , Europe &apos;s towns and cities are key players in the fields of innovation , research and education , and therefore play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the EU 2020 strategy .
Mrs Bow@@ les , I should like to say to you that , if the Lisbon Strategy is , to some degree , a failure , it is because it was designed several years ago when the economic situation was different from what it is today .
This is how universities arose in Italy , Germany , France and Poland , and I think we should not forget that this goal should also guide universities today , while cooperation with business should not hin@@ der or restrict that noble work of searching for truth - the dis@@ interested search for truth .
Not only is it doing nothing , but it is upgrading the advanced status relationship which Morocco currently enjoys and is also seeking , in the case of Israel , to upgrade the association agreement to an advanced @-@ status agreement .
The European Parliament supports strongly all the initiatives which increase the EU presence in the region and , in particular , the most recent one , the Eastern Partnership .
The members of this group , and Mr Sever@@ in and myself in particular , have repeatedly raised the idea of a union between the EU and the countries around the Black Sea , because we believe that cooperation between this region and the EU , but also with its neighbours Turkey and Russia , is very important .
This is something that we cannot remain silent on .
I think it was Mr Lam@@ ass@@ oure who said that it must be better spent .
There is a lack of commitment to that 0.@@ 7 % of our gross national income that we said we would commit to taking on these challenges .
Let me say about age - I do not want to live more years and witness more suffering , more hunger , more poverty , and increasing mortality rates amongst women giving birth and amongst children under five .
Very low interoperability . Fourthly , we have created conditions in which we can , within five years , determine strategic investment needs .
Madam President , I am a strong suppor@@ ter of the transport of freight by rail .
The right to a fair trial for sus@@ pects or def@@ end@@ ants is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The right to interpretation between sus@@ pects and their lawyers , for example , is not always guaranteed .
The perpetrators of this co@@ war@@ dly de@@ ed , whilst few in number , believe justice can be administered through murder , be@@ atings and intim@@ id@@ ation .
Therefore , Madam President , I am also appealing to the European institutions to intervene .
One of the main aims of the agenda is to bring in universal access to the Internet and combat digital exclusion .
I protest , Commissioner : I am very disappointed .
At present , the innocent have to suffer .
I hope that we can stop them .
This is an absolutely unacceptable situation , in the context of the definition in most countries .
Since 1 May 2009 , it has also been possible to use this fund to support workers made redundant as a result of the effects of the economic crisis and of the financial markets , which makes it even more relevant and necessary .
The report also calls for Member States to fully involve regional and local authorities in implementing policies and I am sure that when Scotland is independent , the Scottish Government will fully involve all Scotland &apos;s regions in these matters .
In this time of economic , financial and social crisis , funds to motiv@@ ate the European Union &apos;s growth and competitiveness are crucial .
Deb@@ t cancellation impa@@ irs Third World deb@@ tor countries from raising further international finance .
The Commission will not recommend the vote if we are not convinced that it is for the benefit of European citizens .
Do not forget that we have to deal with a huge competitive global market in India , China and the USA .
I hope that these proposals will result in us being able to systematically resolve the problems that remain in this area following previous efforts , including those of Mr Gau@@ z@@ ès and the previous Commission and the Council - for which we are grateful ; and that we are able to do so without creating a new monopoly , but rather by consistently getting to gri@@ ps with the problems of incentives and regulation .
The Commission did not , in fact , consider this , wanting merely to ensure that key information really is contained in the summary .
I am therefore delighted that Parliament has adopted this revised directive on prospec@@ t@@ uses at first reading .
Only then will he or she be able to make informed decisions .
That is because what must also be sustainable is a social model that has to look after a population that is expected to age considerably over the next 20 years , and the care of this population cannot be allowed to continue to fall exclusively into the voluntary hands of women .
I agree with you because , actually , we know what we want and we know why we want it .
( DE ) Mr President , in recent years and decades , the European Union has been at the van@@ guard of equal treatment of women and men .
We have before us the European Champ@@ ionships organised in two years &apos; time by Poland and Ukraine , so I am extremely pleased with the decision made by Mr Bel@@ et , Mrs Pack and Mrs V@@ assi@@ li@@ ou , who has been so actively involved in this , that harmonisation of legislation is needed in this area .
The only exemptions from this regulation should be sub@@ urban and urban transport .
( RO ) Intro@@ ducing a standard framework for the harmonised deployment of Intel@@ ligent Transport Systems is an important step towards modernis@@ ing the transport sector .
For the Council , it was absolutely out of the question .
It is unacceptable for accidents to happen in which people can even lose their lives simply because many seaf@@ ar@@ ers speak different languages .
I saw it in Mannheim ; I have seen it in business parks , etc .
I also read very carefully your proposals on the future of direct payments as an instrument not only to guarantee the stability of farmers &apos; income , but also to ensure a minimum level of provision of public goods .
Wales has a strong history of agriculture and many communities depend heavily upon farming .
It supports multilater@@ alism , is a member of the G20 and is a key player in global debates on climate change , economic governance , the reform of the UN , trade issues and the eradication of poverty .
This should not need to be the case .
Thank you .
Unfortunately , the word &apos; extensive &apos; has been used in the translations .
We affir@@ m that the international law that applies is determined by what is laid down within Resolution 124@@ 4 / 99 of the United Nations Security Council .
Firstly , the primary obligation of the European Union is to take care of our own citizens , especially when it relates to the fishing industry , because they have been involved in it for years , and their ancest@@ ors for hundreds and thousands of years , and they must be protected .
Firstly , a European Union diplomatic service , not an inter @-@ governmental service , and this means an assurance that 60 % of posts will be appointed by the European Union .
Parliament &apos;s support for their prohibition and eradication is fully justified .
Indeed , we got a good number of our amendments adopted , the most important one pointing out that , even if international trade in fish products can lead to increased food security in developing countries , it has also led to increased fishing in order to supply the export market , which can exacerb@@ ate stock deple@@ tion .
Finally , it is important that Parliament is informed that , at a meeting with Zim@@ bab@@ we@@ an Ministers representing the Government of National Un@@ ity on 2 July , Baroness Ashton , the High Representative and Vice @-@ President , rec@@ alled that the implementation of the global political agreement , which addresses our concern about human rights , the rule of law and democratic principles , is key to achieving normali@@ sation of relations with the EU .
We look forward to receiving this communication between now and the end of November .
That is why we absolutely agree with the amendment tabled by Mr C@@ all@@ an@@ an to delete paragraph 17 and I would also note that paragraph 22 puts a financial burden on extraction companies which we should be careful about .
For that reason , I strongly advocate not granting new licences until that liability has been regulated .
Mod@@ els are in place .
Once fin@@ alised , the Commission will present them to the Member States and the stakeholders within the Social Protection Committee .
I believe that rigi@@ dity and bureaucracy are always lying in wait .
( LT ) The EU @-@ China summit is taking place today in Brussels .
Allow me to dig@@ ress a little .
In my opinion , now we need to dare to look ahead and have the courage to ask whether the money today is going to the right places and having the impact it is intended to .
At the same time , I would like to express sympathy and solidarity with my Hungarian fellow Members and what they are currently experiencing with the toxic sp@@ il@@ lage .
Freedom trium@@ ph@@ ed , but with freedom come obligations .
I agree with the European Social Fund having its own rules to the extent that they apply to tasks and the thematic definition of its activities .
Furthermore , the economic crisis has also triggered a large number of bankrupt@@ cies in the textile industry , resulting in a huge wave of redundancies .
I can only wholeheartedly support this resolution , which sees Parliament taking the side of the weak@@ est and most defen@@ cel@@ ess .
in writing . - I support this report which seeks , in light of the EU &apos;s commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and hal@@ ve extreme poverty by 2015 , to address the most pressing health problems in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and the question of what systems can be put in place to do so .
The first is that there is no mathematical link between the length of maternity leave and women &apos;s fertili@@ ty rate , and to prove it I need only mention the situation in France , since France is a country which provides for 14 weeks &apos; maternity leave and which , today , has one of the highest birth rates in Europe .
One size simply does not fit all .
I was lucky enough to be present at the deliveries of two of my three children .
Coming back to the reports we were discussing today , and with regard to Mrs Thom@@ sen &apos;s report on precarious work , I have taken careful note of what has been said .
( SK ) The Treaty of Lisbon entails new tasks and obligations for both the European Parliament and the European Commission .
On the other hand , however , it then says that the Commission asked the US Government not to request data which undermine access to European databases .
( DE ) Mr President , the annual conference of N@@ AF@@ O made amendments to the Otta@@ wa Convention of 1 January 1979 .
In particular , I would mention the process of establishing standards .
Those EUR 8@@ 80 billion should be creating wealth in the developing countries .
However , at no time have we defined the means for implementing such a strategy , which means we will fail and our fellow citizens will become di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ed .
This has been the ESF &apos;s role since it was set up under the Treaty of Rome , and it must keep employment as its prime objective .
We need , here , effective psychological care and speed in giving help .
It is an example of the fact that we are taking the situation of job threats seriously .
I believe that this is a positive development and have had no qu@@ al@@ ms in supporting the rapporteur .
Com@@ b@@ ating prec@@ ari@@ ousness and the double burden of work on women should be the EU &apos;s most pressing objectives , and I therefore support this report , as it represents a step in that direction .
My support is based on my commitment to changing the current unfair situation in which women have fewer opportunities to access employment , the majority of them are in more precarious jobs , and they continue to earn less than men for doing the same job .
I will make four points .
If we follow the content of this communication , it will mean that there will be no review until 2014 .
Par@@ tly I see the glass half full , because it talks about own resources , a subject that this Parliament was hoping would be dealt with some time ago so as to reduce the Member States &apos; contributions and increase the chance of making the major investments that Europe needs .
In the run @-@ up to the next EU @-@ Africa summit ( Tri@@ poli , 29 and 30 November ) , many of those concerned are anxious that the strategic partnership should place greater emphasis on food security , including issues relating to access to food , infrastructures , land ownership and adjustment to climate change .
At the meeting of Directors @-@ General organised by the Belgian Presidency last September as a remedy to the absorption problems , notably , to the problem of access to capital , the Commission recommended financial engineering techniques such as the use of facilit@@ ators or the simplification of procedures and application forms .
I hope that this new approach can be a real opportunity for change .
Then we can have a feedback into prep@@ are@@ dness , prevention and response in the case of any future disaster .
In our opinion , however , you have now taken a step backwards , because the call for treaty infringement proceedings to be initiated on account of there being discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin has just been supported once again by the documents that a few speakers have already mentioned and which have been referred to in French newspapers today .
The proposed penalty options will initially apply only to the countries of the euro area .
We owe our citizens a suitable , rapid response so that we can emerge from the crisis more quickly and strongly .
However , the difference does not extend beyond the borders of the euro area , which might be assumed to be the case from an economic perspective .
It represents major progress in relations with the Commission and is an important step towards closer cooperation .
It is true that there have been several political statements promising that the interests of the new Member States will be taken into account .
I welcome the vote in plenary which , with 6@@ 11 votes for , 38 against and 6 ab@@ sten@@ tions , strengthens Parliament &apos;s position on CE@@ POL .
The European budget is not complementary to national budgets ; it compet@@ es with and ra@@ ids them .
In this regard , the Committee on Budgets has sent out a clear signal by op@@ ting to respect the margins imposed by the current financial situation and implementing a tough policy based on priorities to encourage growth with the emphasis on research , innovation and young people .
I believe , in fact , that European law must establish a general framework that offers minimum guarantees and safeguards within which Member States can be left room to decide on the most suitable measures at their own discretion .
Ful@@ filling contractual obligations in commercial transactions by both public and private administrations is not merely a question of civi@@ c duty , but also of taking responsibility for a set of negative conditions that could afflic@@ t credi@@ tor companies , particularly SMEs .
However , I think that more attention must be focused on groups at a high risk of poverty , such as the rural population or the Roma ethnic minority .
The proposals before us result from the mid @-@ term review conducted by the Commission in 2009 at Parliament &apos;s request .
Inci@@ dentally , the Commission has not , stran@@ gely enough , carried out even once , between 1994 and now , an assessment of the assistance &apos;s impact on these 12 countries , which is something that must be changed in the future .
He said that 65 million more human beings will be pl@@ ung@@ ed into extreme poverty in our world this year alone .
This is all right , but we need to exert our full scrutiny on strategy papers , multiannual indic@@ ative programmes and the like , as they are of a general scope and supplement the financial instruments by defining priority areas and objectives .
That should really be stopped and we should clarify , for the period after 2013 , that this is really for conflict situations , and maybe add more flexibility to other instruments in order to address more emergency situations .
However , even in the budget which we passed today , when it comes to achieving the 2020 targets , I believe that - for example , in research and innovation - we have failed to respond and we will not be able to attain the targets we want with these figures .
Cri@@ tical to food production at affordable prices are the millions of small farmers and land@@ less farmers now at the mercy of the land@@ l@@ ord class .
Prot@@ ecting our co@@ asts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy .
Not for the first time in discussing integrated maritime policies , the Parliament has led by example .
Coming out with pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des and good wishes for the workers in the European ship@@ yards , who are concerned about their jobs , is simply not enough .
It must be said , however , that the resolution does not go very far in this direction .
In making a reminder of the right of Moldo@@ van citizens to vote , &apos; calls on &apos; should be replaced by &apos; states that &apos; and after &apos; Trans@@ ni@@ stri@@ a &apos; , &apos; have no right to prevent ... &apos; should be inserted .
At the same time , Europe must dev@@ ise measures supporting intervention in the case of disasters , like the one in the Gulf of Mexico , and must submit a coordinated European action plan to prevent emergency situations and tackle disasters caused by dri@@ lling ri@@ gs , at global level , especially where cross @-@ border pollution occurs .
Consumers must be able to benefit from a single level of protection , no matter what they buy , and farmers must be rewarded for their tremendous efforts , not subjected to de facto unfair competition on the part of third countries .
People who have already been e@@ vic@@ ted should be given legal protection , as should their property , the victims should be given compensation and redress , and first and foremost all people should be guaranteed shelter and access to food and water .
author . - Mr President , Sam Ra@@ ins@@ y is a colleague of ours , a member of the parliament in Cambodia .
Kyoto runs out in two years , but we need certainty and time to adapt .
The resolution adopted by Parliament in March last year contains many ideas as to how to strengthen those institutional mechanisms for dialogue between Brussels and Washington .
The upcoming summit between the European Union and the United States will be the first summit after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , one of the aims of which was to enable Europe to concentrate more on relations with third countries .
If interinstitutional relations continue in this way , there is a risk that we will end up in the same psychological situation with the US in respect of PNR as was the case with SWIFT .
The European Securities and Markets Authority will be the supervisory body .
We are convinced that if this platform can be made to work better than it does today - which is the aim of the action plan - then everything built on it - private and public initiatives , local , regional , national and European initiatives , the activities of associations and the whole range of other bodies within the market - will also work better .
I think the Presidency has been working under strict time constraints , since the Commission &apos;s proposal was submitted on 6 October 2010 and we are now preparing our conclusions for the Council meeting of 26 November .
According to data supplied by the Commission , in 2006 @-@ 2008 , only 45 illegal immigrants throughout the entire European Union were found to have come from Taiwan .
Cr@@ è@@ ches and nur@@ series are , and always will be , a compromise .
Fourthly , the Commission must be politically accountable .
We also heard about the high cost of compliance with EU regulations , so that we do not have a level playing field for third country imports .
In this way , we will be able to find optimal solutions so that our citizens &apos; data is only used according to strictly regulated rules and the protection of their personal data is guaranteed .
I also welcome the choice of subject for the first partnership : active and healthy ageing .
The OSCE monitoring and field missions are an important part of the expansion of the free world .
At the same time , the EU should be responsible for exchanges of best practice between the Member States , for monitoring the implementation of EU legislation in the Member States , and for taking the initiative in adopting new legislation in these fields .
If we do not manage to reverse the current trend , it is estimated that by 2030 , demographic change will result in a two @-@ to @-@ one ratio between the active and in@@ active populations .
This not only applies to financial and budgetary policy , but also includes protecting the environment , the available resources and the climate .
Given the current situation , the European Parliament believes in the need to initiate a dialogue aimed at inter@@ gener@@ ational relationships .
Beyond the one @-@ off response to the sharp rise in cere@@ al prices that prompted the crisis of livestock farming , Parliament wishes to raise the issue of the place that the European Union wants European agriculture to have in the global market , namely , produce with strict standards that are imposed on our commercial partners in order to have fair competition .
We cannot ignore the fact that the Member States &apos; economic and financial problems still affect the euro in all its aspects .
We have delivered price stability over the nearly 12 years of the euro and we are credible for the next ten years according to all the information we have .
The aim of the proposed plan is to ensure sustainable fishing by establishing quotas based on scientific criteria .
The vote will take place tomorrow ( Tuesday , 23 November 2010 ) .
On the contrary , it means more red tape , increased costs and risks to patients .
This is obvious , so it is also obvious that Parliament , the Commission and everybody involved has shown a great deal of goodwill .
Wher@@ ever women are granted rights in the world , respect for human dignity and the values of equality and fr@@ at@@ ernity - which are EU values - will be promoted .
In many cases , they are far better pre@@ dis@@ posed to carrying out the tasks of peace missions .
In addition , this cannot be continued after 20@@ 18 , for example , in Germany &apos;s case , because the treaty , which applies to those involved and not just to the state , requires everything to come to an end in 20@@ 18 , so that the long @-@ term costs of pit clo@@ sures do not have to be borne by the state .
We should not therefore succ@@ um@@ b to the illusion that winding down coal mines is a sort of political end in itself .
This is why we are asking that the Russian military build @-@ up within the international borders of Georgia be qualified as illegal occupation of a sovereign territory .
This arrangement could , in the final analysis , be reflected in the retail price of medicines sold to the public .
As the President of the Delegation for relations with the Mas@@ hre@@ q countries , I am pleased to vote in favour of this report , the aim of which is to strengthen cooperation in science and technology between the European Union and Jordan .
It is also worth pointing out that there is a great deal of development under way in Jordan in terms of higher education , which may contribute greatly to the success of this cooperation .
The postp@@ on@@ ement will make it possible to give companies the necessary legal certainty but also to carry out further evalu@@ ations with regard to a satisfactory level of standard VAT rates throughout the EU .
If the Stockholm Programme is mis@@ used for this purpose , it would amount to an indirect change in legislation , which is precisely what the Union has long been fighting against .
In my opinion , the European Parliament &apos;s negoti@@ ators should not exacerb@@ ate the situation in the talks , but , on the contrary , should aim to reach an agreement .
By agreeing to the limits imposed by the Council on the growth figure , the 2.@@ 91 % we are all familiar with , Parliament &apos;s aim is to send out a strong signal that it is sensitive to the period we are living through .
Key priorities , such as transparency and consumer protection , will be pursued , while a bank crisis framework will aim to prevent and tackle future crises .
We must make sure that the citizens &apos; initiative helps to support and develop Europe .
This initiative is included in the Commission work programme for 2011 as a strategic initiative to tap the potential of the single market for growth .
Commissioner , we are very concerned about the Commission &apos;s insi@@ stence on subjec@@ ting agriculture and food production to the market and competitiveness .
If we go down the route of gre@@ ening the first pillar of the common agricultural policy , we will unfortunately increase cross @-@ compliance , we will be counting nature , we will be sending people out to farms and we will not achieve simplification .
That is our message .
I think this is very important and should be an element in the CAP .
Let me highlight some of the key achievements : first and foremost , the European Union wanted this Summit to make progress on joint action to boost global growth and jobs and to give answers on how to address global imbalances and currency tensions .
The Irish authorities estimate total losses caused directly by the disaster to be EUR 5@@ 20.@@ 9 million .
The EU maintains its view that a single legally binding instrument is the best way to give shape to the post @-@ 2012 framework .
We strongly welcome the support indicated in the motion for a resolution to ensure that the EU speaks with one voice .
If climate change is not hal@@ ted or at least limited , the poorest countries and the poorest people will be the first to be bur@@ nt by our fast over@@ heating planet .
A great number of leaders , from both Europe and Africa , have confirmed that they will be taking part at the highest level .
While I do accept that Morocco is an important ally of the West in the fight against terrorism , it is deeply regrettable that Morocco will not deliver on its stated commitments to the terms of the UN settlement plan .
This is a good idea .
The latest violent events linked to the dispute between Morocco and the Poli@@ s@@ ario Front over the Western Sahara require greater attention due to the negative effects they could have on stability in the region .
Another very recent decision taken by the Constitutional Court , which is open to various interpretations , is the duration of the current parliament &apos;s mandate .
I would be very grateful if we could pay serious consideration here in Parliament over the next few weeks and months to the contribution that other areas of policy could make to trade policy in this respect .
Regarding agricultural products , at the moment we are deeply worried about the cost of production , supply and security of food .
I regard it as a positive signal from the speech of European Commission Vice @-@ President Š@@ ef@@ č@@ ovi@@ č that the Commission intends to review the possibility of introducing procedural rules for investigations , setting out various aspects of the procedure for breaches of the law , including time limits , the right to a hearing , the obligation to provide reasons and so on .
This is always the Commission &apos;s proposal .
We must also assess the possibility of ex@@ changing information on a more frequent and global level about competition , as well as the possibility of establishing global governance in this area .
Cooperation between international organisations should be stepped up as part of a global agreement on climate , especially at the level of carbon inclusion mechanisms for the EU &apos;s emissions trading scheme , while ensuring , however , that existing le@@ ak@@ age is stopped .
I am absta@@ ining from the vote , because I would question whether it would actually be possible to implement what the rapporteur has proposed .
Moreover , making women visible on the ground would enable us to make populations more aware of the in@@ humane nature of the use of rape as a weapon of war , and perhaps to put an end to the impunity enjoyed by perpetrators of such violence .
I also voted in favour because I agree with the Commission guaranteeing that common agricultural policy aid to the be@@ ekeeping sector will be increased after 2013 .
The creation of instruments for providing incentives for the development and modernisation of energy networks would also be an interesting strategy , which I would support .
However , I regret the fact that this House has postponed the vote already two times , which has resulted in a situation that the EU @-@ Ukraine summit , for which the resolution was drafted , has taken place before our vote .
I am in favour of pursuing commercial policies aimed at differenti@@ ating between products and services based on their climate impact .
As was stated earlier , the whole country is like an open prison .
I feel a little aw@@ k@@ ward doing this , because it is not only my group &apos;s request ; several other groups support this idea .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Migration must be fair .
As the Commissioner said , regional policy is nothing less than investment policy .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly , I find it regrettable that an important debate on cohesion policy has once again been pushed almost into last place on the agenda .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that you will accept this report and will vote for it , in general terms , in this House .
However , I also consider it symbolic that we will debate on and adopt the report on the situation of human rights in the world tomorrow .
It must also be remembered that many people are exploited because they do not have decent living conditions in their countries of origin : they live in poverty and in desper@@ ation and are ready to do anything - even leave their own country for the promise of a better life , which , al@@ as , is never to be found .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , I , too , would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs .
Often , in fact , those who suffer the violence of trafficking not only suffer injuries , but also the insu@@ lt of being inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ated for doing what they were comp@@ elled to do , prostitution being a typical example .
We , of course , voted in favour of this report , which proposes mobili@@ sing the Solidarity Fund to address the enormous damage that occurred on the island of Madeira following the storm that struck the region in February 2010 .
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that , in respect of the general budget of the European Union for the 2010 financial year , the European Union Solidarity Fund should be mobili@@ sed to provide the sum of EUR 66 8@@ 91 5@@ 40 in commitment and payment appropriations in order to address the applications made by :
I therefore voted in favour of it .
EUR 500 million is the annual ceiling for the funds that can be mobili@@ sed through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
In this way , we shall all be winners , but Georgia &apos;s citizens most of all .
For this reason , the capacity of regional and local authorities to implement EU policy has been strengthened .
This will ensure transparent regulations , security and legal protection for workers who suffer discrimination , a continued fight against illegal immigration and , finally , measures to combat unfair competition .
They should be considered as an asset to the EU economy and not as a threat to EU workers .
By bringing together the acquis communautaire in this area and concentrating it within a single text , this directive is destined to play a major role in the fight against human trafficking .
I voted in favour because I support cohesion , if only so that all Lat@@ vian bri@@ bers will be locked up in ga@@ ol and therefore no longer in a position to interfere with the proper application of the EU Structural Funds .
Will you support him in this ?
My question is this : do you think this is being used to sup@@ press the facility to transfer data ?
I would like to thank the budget rapporteurs , Mrs J@@ ę@@ dr@@ ze@@ je@@ w@@ ska and Mrs Trü@@ pel .
My question about this is : is an EU tax part of that ?
I say that to myself , but I say it also to the Council and the Commission , and I think we need to examine and review how we have worked in the past .
I would simply like to say to you that this modification , this amendment of the regulation , is a first step in granting the necessary supervisory powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority , and that , as has been said , other revi@@ sions of this regulation will take place shortly .
When I speak about immediate implementation or a number of actions which could be undertaken immediately , then I am talking about adaptation , technology , combating de@@ fore@@ station and financing .
The number of people at risk of poverty in Europe increased by 1.5 % between 2004 and 2008 , rising from 15 % to 16.@@ 5 % .
So the question is this : why this low take @-@ up rate in Greece ?
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - I can only repeat that the cost of an impro@@ per functioning of justice , or the cost of not treating human beings as human beings should be treated in a Europe of rights , is much higher than the cost of investing in those basic rights .
The buildings policy is also important .
It is important to report positive experiences from other countries , not forgetting China and the United States , and to invest in the funding of measures that increase energy efficiency in buildings , in social housing , and in transport and industry .
Commissioner , you have indicated that you will be working in two stages .
We need to show that the European Union is in control of events , that we have a course of action that we are sti@@ cking to , and that we speak with one voice and act as one .
We faced two particular issues with Greece and Ireland .
If we do not stop this crisis of confidence , we will have major problems over the next few years .
And you never know , David Cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the United Kingdom .
That is our duty today , to adopt such policies , in defence of our common currency .
Secondly , as action should be led on prevention and early intervention , there is a need to better harmonise conditions for early intervention and for activ@@ ating the crisis @-@ management mechanisms , whilst avoiding , of course , over @-@ regulation .
This could lead to the submission of false signatures and therefore de@@ tract from the popular democratic value of the initiative .
With this in mind , communication activities and information campaigns play an important role .
I apologise for this but that is the way it is going to be .
Europe must pione@@ er a new sustainable economic model , based on lower use of resources , including energy , with greater productivity .
One group I want to commend though .
In practical terms , the budget remains within the limits set by the Council but , at the same time , it also includes some of the legislative &apos;s priorities .
Once again we reiterate that there is an alternative to this budget , and that is not only possible , but also truly necessary .
I supported this text as it provides a welcome adjustment to the law on metro@@ logy .
In fact , enabling millions of citizens to suggest to the European Commission that it should legisl@@ ate on a given issue is a very positive step on the path of bringing Europe closer to its citizens .
Adverti@@ sing also makes an important contribution to providing consumers with information .
I think one thing which should be stressed is that Christians still constitute the most persec@@ uted religious group in the world , and they are suffering discrimination , being attacked and often even being killed in almost every part of the world .
The problem of fundamental rights , most importantly women &apos;s rights , remains intact .
They should also include building and reforming the administration and the public service cor@@ ps by training programmes , help with construction and the use of existing infrastructure and advice from the EU .
In cop@@ ing with all these duties , the European Union should not only preserve its strategic connection with NATO but should also be able to make its intellectual and political contribution with regard to maintaining NATO &apos;s ability to deter , and its ability to defend Member States against any aggression , in a context different from the one which determined the birth of the alliance .
Indeed , we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty .
I also call on the North Korean authorities to lift restrictions on the ability of international staff to monitor the distribution of aid , and to ensure that international aid reaches the need@@ y .
The lives of these people will be end@@ angered .
The third point that was particularly important to us , as Social Democrats , was improving worker protection and the fact that this has also been explicitly incorporated once again .
Not@@ withstanding the fact that those responsible for what happened must be properly identified , the consequences clearly established and the destination of the contaminated products properly tra@@ ced , this incident also requires us to reflect more carefully on the complete failure of the existing regulatory model .
This means that our approach is extremely important in how the whole issue is being addressed .
As you now go further and negotiate the agreements , I hope that you will continue to fight specifically against illegally logged timber and not against the trade in timber .
( DE ) Madam President , in my opinion , although the partnership agreement with Cam@@ ero@@ on in the forestry sector is indeed pra@@ ise@@ worthy and comes during the International Year of Fore@@ sts , it is also a very convenient way for the EU to improve its image .
Please keep us informed of developments .
( NL ) Madam President , at the moment , the economic crisis in Serbia and in the Western Balkans is coming to a head .
And until you learn about it and apply it , there is no place for you here .
There are clearly many challenges remaining : the fight against organised crime , continued legal reforms and finding a solution to the minorities issues .
I regard the fact that they have chosen this path of their own vo@@ li@@ tion as a guarantee that Serbia will take all the necessary measures .
I voted in favour of this resolution , which stresses the need for European policy to give priority to agriculture .
If what we are doing today and tomorrow is a small step towards this , because it will become clearer which countries have good services and which have poor services , which are doing something for their citizens and which are not , then we will have achieved a great deal .
Imp@@ lement this so that we strengthen patients &apos; rights instead of reducing them .
I do not , however , believe that we should be satisfied with this alone , but rather that it should be the beginning of a much greater step forward , so that , as Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt was saying , this directive becomes just a formali@@ ty because the level of equality achieved in all Member States means it is unnecessary for each citizen to be returned to their country .
( The sitting was suspended at 20 : 15 and resumed at 21 : 00 )
The non @-@ Member States of the euro area are , in fact , divided into two categories : the United Kingdom and Sweden , which are not obliged to adopt the euro , and the other states which , together with the members , represent 25 states .
I think it is critically important that we have a strong response regarding stability of the euro area ; that we are not , as happened sometimes in the past , behind the curve but ahead of the curve ; that we give a comprehensive response which re@@ stores confidence in the determination of the euro area and the European Union as a whole , and not just by statements but by acting .
While we have an incomplete single market , red tape bur@@ dening companies and entrepreneurs , and a mess@@ y labour market , our EU growth might turn out to be that of a wh@@ ale in a pool of bar@@ ra@@ cu@@ das - because such is the global market in today &apos;s crisis context .
It sad@@ dens me that the implementation of the Hungarian Presidency programme could be jeopardis@@ ed by the government &apos;s attacks on the rule of law .
Romania should be assessed fairly according to the same criteria which were applied to the states which joined the Schengen area before us .
This directive establishes rules for facilitating access to cross @-@ border healthcare that is safe and of high quality , and which promotes healthcare cooperation between the Member States , while fully respecting national juris@@ dic@@ tions .
I would point out that this House took that same position at first and second reading , by codi@@ fying the Court &apos;s case @-@ law on cross @-@ border treatment ( European citizens have the right to be treated in another country as if it were their own ) and sharing the Council &apos;s desire to combat medical tourism .
It therefore represents a significant step forward in European integration , which is why I voted in favour of this report .
The Inter@@ im Agreement covers rules of origin and market access issues .
Regarding rules of origin , it covers fisheries , textiles and agriculture , leading to investment and employment opportunities .
Dem@@ enti@@ a is a group of neuro@@ de@@ gener@@ ative diseases which should not be thought of as a normal part of ageing .
It is estimated that almost 10 million people in Europe suffer from de@@ men@@ tia , and the majority of them from Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
What are we waiting for - as I asked straight away - to send a commission to check the situation of our Cop@@ tic Christian brethren in Egypt , an officially moderate country where they have practically no fundamental human rights at all , not even in public office , in the civil service ?
( SK ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , I would like to address you and to make a strong appeal to you in this matter , as it is simply unacceptable to us that Christians in the Middle East continue to face such mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess attacks .
Unfortunately , the Hom@@ o So@@ vie@@ tic@@ us inst@@ inc@@ ts of Lu@@ kas@@ henko proved more en@@ during than anything else .
Finally , when I met the families and the opposition leaders who came to meet with me , I was absolutely clear with them that we expected to see people released from prison and Belarus move forward , in the way that we would all wish , towards real democracy .
In accordance with the Treaties , the examination of asylum applications falls under the competence of the Member States .
I have to admit that I have a feeling of both hope and des@@ pair about this .
I think there is a huge role to be played here by the European Union and the international community .
For us Hungarian Members , this is particularly important with a view to support for the Danube strategy , as any request for support for the Danube strategy can only be credible if we remain open to supporting other strategies as well .
The European Parliament also has to make ful@@ lest use of the options that are there .
The government has also formed a committee to review all discriminatory laws , including the blas@@ ph@@ emy law .
It should be said clearly that there is a certain sense in which their failure to act and their lack of reaction mean they share responsibility for these things .
Seven people lost their lives on the barri@@ ca@@ des defending Lat@@ vian independence , and many were injured .
The comment I would like to make , and it is a rational comment , is that any programmes concerning the Roma in the European Union which come from the Commission are frag@@ mented and are often included within the framework of social exclusion .
Germany now seems to be following the Schä@@ uble course .
Now , if you will permit me , I would like to make another point about this Council : I hope that it will also draw up a European Union strategy for the Mediterranean ; I hope that it will draw up a response to the situations currently being experienced in Tunisia and Egypt .
But we have always maintained that these principles should be realised from within , not imposed from outside .
We all remember the attack against Cop@@ tic Christians that took place over Christmas , right there in Egypt .
We owe it to the Su@@ dan@@ ese people in both North and South to stand by them and offer them support and encouragement at this critical time .
What matters is the way in which these texts will be put into effect .
In these countries , the same companies continue to produce bananas .
It is for that reason that we added 8.@@ 4 % to the EUR 2@@ 45 million provided for the PO@@ SE@@ I envel@@ ope .
These will in turn bring improvements to the banana market and to our European producers , which are impossible without a sound basis such as that provided by fin@@ alising these disputes within the WTO , to which the European Union belongs .
The Tuber@@ culosis V@@ acc@@ ine Initiative ( T@@ B@@ VI ) , an organisation supported by the European Union , offers a solution to the current situation by creating accessible vaccines at affordable prices , which can be supplied to the population through a structured vaccination programme .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament will today give its ver@@ dict for a second time on the amendment to the financing instrument for development cooperation providing for the establishment of Ban@@ ana Ac@@ compan@@ ying Meas@@ ures for the main ACP banana @-@ producing countries .
It is important that the second instrument allows for this assistance to be given irrespective of the consent of the governments of third countries and other public authorities .
As far as the scope of the directive is concerned , I personally prefer a limited scope , because I am concerned that an open scope would include equipment that cannot fe@@ asi@@ bly be recy@@ cled or equipment with a long working life , thereby putting at risk the fulfilment of the agreed collection targets .
Whenever we propose any proposal , we also have to take into account the burden of the costs and make things as simple as possible .
If anybody thinks it can continue like that in the 21st century then they are simply terri@@ bly mistaken .
With the adoption of this text , the Member States must now make an effort to fulfil their own financial commitments , particularly with regard to developing countries , so that the right to health can also mean a right to preventive care .
We have worked very well without the EU in the county of Hamp@@ shire , where the E@@ PC is situated .
In this case , well @-@ founded concerns have been expressed here , which we share , about a possible delay in the transfer of the funds foreseen in the banana accompanying measures as a result of the current dispute between Parliament and the Council .
Indeed , we are calling on the Member States to ensure that producers foot the bill for the collection and treatment of products to be recy@@ cled .
I would like to highlight the fact that my home country of Germany is in a particularly good position in this respect and has put in place balanced recycling solutions for businesses and consumers .
The global spread of tuberculosis remains a concern , with this disease continuing to feature among the main causes of mortality worldwide , causing the death of around 2 million people every year .
I do not believe that we are an isolated case in Europe on this issue , either .
The voice of the people must be he@@ eded .
Let us make use of the enhanced cooperation in the Treaty , without a mad rush that could de@@ tract from and prevent its consolidation .
However , it should also pay for this itself .
The second reason relates to substance .
Another important aspect is also the development of alternative sources of funding .
It can only be successful when the citizens living along the Danube feel that it has taken concrete form and that they can be involved in it .
These stem cells are easy to get hold of if someone is prepared to do it , and I personally do not believe that this should even be treated as a transp@@ l@@ ant matter .
To talk figures , violence against women in the home - to mention just this one , unfortunately very widespread , type - today costs us EUR 1 million every half an hour .
Like all small business@@ men , he is over@@ bur@@ dened with red tape and regulation - much of it eman@@ ating from this place , the European Parliament .
Secondly , like Mr El Kha@@ dra@@ ou@@ i , I depl@@ ore the absence of speed limitation devices , as it means that we will continue to be over@@ taken on motor@@ ways by the only vehicles that no longer keep to the speed limit , namely , light commercial vehicles .
I hope the Commission respects its commitment to submit a specific legislative proposal on this before the end of this year .
I am particularly pleased by the fact that passengers with reduced mobility have been included in the document , as I mentioned previously , but , at the same time , I have well @-@ founded concerns in this respect : in the case of air passengers , neither the airlines nor the airports know exactly which passengers are to be regarded as passengers with reduced mobility .
I will not hide the fact that it was an exceptional challenge for me personally to be able to play an active role in the conciliation procedure for the first time in history under the Treaty of Lisbon .
As for the rest of it , we would ask to return to the issue as soon as possible in order to really protect our citizens .
The reason for this is that some Member States - including Italy and Spain - objec@@ ted on a number of occasions to the adoption of the planned tri@@ lingual system of translation , which would end up becoming truly discriminatory , since it blat@@ antly viol@@ ates the principle of equal status for all official languages of the Union .
I hope that it will prove to be a key step in sp@@ ur@@ ring into action the group of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises which we frequently refer to as &apos; sleeping innov@@ ators &apos; .
The extension of the protocols on fishery concessions and market access are important , long @-@ term regulations in the field of aqu@@ aculture .
I voted in favour of this recommendation because I think it can contribute to the entry into force , implementation and development of the Schengen acquis in countries such as Iceland , the Kingdom of Norway , the Swiss Con@@ federation and the Princip@@ ality of Liechtenstein .
The super @-@ credits to manufacturers producing L@@ CV@@ s with emissions of CO2 of less than 50@@ g CO2 / km will be limited with a threshold of 25 000 L@@ CV@@ s per manufacturer ;
There is no doubt that its legal basis must be adapted to the new Treaty of Lisbon in order to grant Parliament a role in the decision @-@ making process concerning a regulation that potentially affects public health .
Whether just the ratification procedure fails or also the euro project as a whole will depend on the determination of the Heads of Government to take coherent and united action .
Therefore , I think that it is a positive thing that the Commission is taking all possible steps to prepare itself .
We know how fal@@ si@@ fication networks have changed : a few years ago everybody would be talking about Vi@@ agra , but today it is impossible not to talk about drugs that combat , or attempt to combat , diseases such as cancer , diabetes , heart disease and ch@@ ol@@ ester@@ ol .
Yet I do not think our work ends there .
Overall , this is a very good compromise and I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone involved .
These are medicines for the treatment of cancer , heart disease and infections , in other words , situations where someone really is in need of an effective medicine .
Fal@@ si@@ fied medicinal products are a global problem , and should be examined in a global context .
In the 2011 budget , considerable amounts have been allocated to the Global Fund to fight Aids , Tuber@@ culosis and Malaria ( GF@@ ATM ) ( EUR 65 000 000 in commitment appropriations and EUR 47 6@@ 08 9@@ 50 in payment appropriations ) .
It is consumer @-@ focused , it is about reputation , and the reliability of goods produced within the EU .
The socialist party should take responsibility for its role as parliamentary opposition .
The law fore@@ sees that phone ta@@ pping can only be requested by public prosec@@ ut@@ ors or by law enforcement agencies , such as the police and the national security agency , if they suspect that the person in question is involved in criminal activity and after there is authorisation by a judge .
Nevertheless , the World Bank continues to push fossi@@ ls in its energy strategy .
Th@@ re@@ ats of violence against minorities are completely unacceptable .
Or have we obstruc@@ ted it ?
We need to act at EU level to ensure that banks are willing and able to finance SMEs .
Croatia has been meeting the accession criteria with undeni@@ able success , and has been making an effort to continue down this path , despite the additional difficulties it faces in the current international situation .
Yes , our motto , &apos; A strong Europe with a human touch &apos; depends upon all of us .
However , according to the latest forecasts , the world sugar balance should be in balance for the period 2010 @-@ 2011 .
It is important that we have a policy that will support farmers and ensure adequate food supply at a fair price .
We should be self @-@ sufficient in food , and we should help the developing countries to be self @-@ sufficient in food .
On this point , therefore , we are not talking simply of wishes but of concrete proposals .
However , much more than short @-@ term reme@@ dies , what is needed is the courage to establish a new architecture that reconc@@ iles the need to increase food production by 70 % in the next 40 years with the increasingly limited natural resources .
For several years , we have been financing projects on democratic reforms , good governance and respect for human rights .
Mr President , at the beginning of this debate , the Commissioner pra@@ ised the courage of the young people who took to the streets in Egypt and Tunisia and created the u@@ pris@@ ing .
A question to Mr Mart@@ ony@@ i : what was the Or@@ b@@ án government &apos;s justification for aboli@@ shing the par@@ ity @-@ based composition of the media board , as stipulated by the previous media law , which consi@@ sted of a 50 @-@ 50 % ratio of members deleg@@ ated by the government party and the opposition ?
Similarly , my fellow Members also request that the Commission initiate , still in this year , a European regulatory framework to ensure the asser@@ tion of the freedom of the media in the Member States .
Unfortunately , only Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and Sweden are currently meeting these targets .
Let us be clear : at the current level of integration , and considering the diversity of their component economies , the euro area and the European Union will not survive with a budget of 1 % of their collective wealth .
To maintain a balance and ensure that these goods are distributed fairly for exploitation , initiatives such as those discussed in this report should be supported .
A recent visit to Mau@@ rit@@ ania with the Committee on Fisheries - which you also mentioned , Commissioner - confirmed my view on this matter .
Perhaps you could con@@ dense your remarks ?
Mr President , last month , the Catalan Public Television channel ( TV@@ 3 ) was shut down in Valencia by the regional Valen@@ cian government .
After all , it is not only demo@@ graph@@ ers who are aware of the fact that in developed societies , the mortality of the male population is higher than that of the female population practically across the all age ranges and , in the majority of cases , significantly so .
The World Health Organisation cri@@ ed wolf and , with its h@@ yst@@ eria @-@ fu@@ elling forecasts , forced Member States to take steps that were disproportionate to the known and experienced sever@@ ity of the H@@ 1@@ N@@ 1 epidemic .
The next item is the report by Mrs Est@@ rel@@ a , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on reducing health inequalities in the EU .
Therefore , I welcome this report , which focuses on vulnerable groups and their access to treatment and prev@@ ent@@ ative care ; I consider this to be vitally important .
Ine@@ qualities in health are increasing and this is happening in some countries of the European Union , specifically in my country , Portugal .
We therefore need a common , comprehensive European strategy , which would draw attention to resource management , the registration of professionals , education and training , and which , in turn , should contribute to increasing quality and safety , not only in national but also in cross @-@ border healthcare .
If we want to comply with the Lisbon Treaty , if we want our development policies to be coherent , we need to take action now and I ask you to support this report in full .
The new departments referred to by Mr V@@ au@@ gh@@ an are not needed in this form if we make sensible use of the syn@@ ergy effects within this House .
There is an urgent need for action here .
Madam President , one hundred years ago , women demanded the right to vote and stand for election and today , we are still campa@@ ig@@ ning for equality for women in many areas , particularly in terms of career options , but also in relation to payment for work and social entit@@ lements , particularly in old age .
It is true that women are more resi@@ li@@ ent to the current crisis in terms of job losses .
On the fundamental issue of pensions , the European Commission should be leading the charge in closing the structural gaps between women and men .
It is necessary to point to the hypo@@ critical discourse of some right @-@ wing leaders , calling for a form of taxation of the financial sector , but only at global level , where we all know it is most unlikely to be implemented .
The on@@ us is now on the IMF , and the European Commission , to assess the positives and neg@@ atives of a global financial transactions tax .
The majority of people are employed inform@@ ally in agriculture and have ir@@ regular incomes , which makes it difficult to enforce income tax effectively .
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague , Mr Pap@@ ast@@ am@@ kos , because it presents a very realistic view of trade relations between the European Union and third countries in the agricultural sector .
The rapporteur presents figures that are enligh@@ tening and worrying .
The European Commission should draft a report on the possibilities and options for increasing domestic protein crop production in the EU by means of new policy instruments .
For all these reasons , it is important to continue to demand an end to inequalities and discrimination , which will involve a break with neoliberal policies , and a serious commitment to alternative policies that make the issue of human rights and equality central to EU decision making and policy .
Over the past 10 years , the number of women living in poverty has increased dis@@ proportion@@ ately in relation to men .
The successive budgetary cuts and the restructuring of the state sector have particularly threatened jobs in which women are primarily employed .
However , an imbalance exists there .
Germany &apos;s banks will not meet new international rules for bank capital , so transfer to German banks should also be the issue on your lips .
That is why something must be done about providing a democratic opening .
Has Turkey abandoned its aspirations to accession ?
In the case of Montenegro , this refers to what has been said here ; in the case of Serbia , it means that the answers to the question@@ n@@ aire received have been prepared and will now be evaluated by the Commission ; and in the case of Croatia , it means that the country must finish its home@@ work and prepare in every possible way to ensure that the negotiations can be concluded during the term of the Hungarian Presidency .
I am aware that this European strategy is not going to solve the problem ; I know that a huge amount depends on us , the Roma .
Job creation is extremely difficult and , as a member of numerous youth organisations , I know what the current situation is for young people on the labour market .
I want to know now - and this is a legitimate question - who decided that what should be a twenty @-@ minute session , and we are only eight minutes into it , should be reduced to an eight or nine @-@ minute session .
I would ask each and every Member who ca@@ res about it to contact their Group leaders and tell them what they think , because I am stuck with the agenda as I find it when I take over the chair and I do not enjoy it .
Modern industrial policy is so much more than that .
Produc@@ ers are allowed to offer their opinions , but they must also accept responsibility , and that means ultimate responsibility for the product .
All this has been happening without any definite conclusions being drawn .
However , I am disappointed by the lack of support from the PPE for an agreement urging the EU to prepare a plan and equi@@ p itself to cope with the aftermath of the Liby@@ an crisis , particularly concerning migration policy and relocation .
Indeed , on the one hand , the establishment of a permanent stability mechanism represents a decisive and important step for@@ wards .
I shall exercise my discretion .
Then you put your whole heart into serving the Olympic movement , and now , as a stat@@ es@@ man , you represent your country , and the European Union too , both outside the Union and in Europe .
Large , poorly functioning systems believed to be un@@ chan@@ geable must be re@@ organised and re@@ considered , and conditions better able to weather crises , which promote development and protect competitiveness , are needed .
It is precisely because we learnt from the last crisis that we are getting involved in industrial policy in the European Union again , especially as , before the last crisis , there were quite a large number of people who believed that money could be easily earned with money .
The anti @-@ Strasbourg group is becoming organised and fle@@ xing its muscles more and more , in an attempt to make people believe that Parliament is unanimously against Strasbourg .
That , too , must change .
I agree with the resolution on the European strategy for the Atlantic region , which will contribute to the region &apos;s sustainable development .
The difference is that overcoming the barrier which confron@@ ts the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia requires the agreement of two states .
This assessment is very fair , but it needs to be realised that , very often , the solutions which we come up with are inadequate or not understood by the Roma .
In Hungary , where the Roma currently make up between 6 % and 8 % of the population , they will exceed 50 % of the working population by 2050 .
The Roma must make their contribution , send their children to school , integrate themselves better into the labour market and put an end to criminal tendencies .
They took to the streets because they wanted greater democracy .
They also wanted to protest against the intoler@@ ance and repression of a fla@@ wed regime .
Our position is absolutely clear .
Let us just have the meetings and actually , for the very first time , get the en@@ vo@@ ys meeting with the negoti@@ ators and having the chance to explore the positions in a way that we have not done before .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank honourable Members for this opportunity to disp@@ el some widely held mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding the Irish programme .
The Commission &apos;s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties .
The European Commission has quite simply re@@ drawn the map .
The debate is closed .
Media pluralism and freedom is one of the EU &apos;s fundamental principles , guaranteeing the freedom to express opinions and to receive and communicate information without control , interference or pressure from public authorities .
We have already seen such double standards in the case of Greece , which , rather than being punished , was rewarded with EUR 120 billion , while Bulgaria worries about its future in the euro area being on hold .
The European Union has already done a lot towards repa@@ iring the banking system , but here also we need to do more .
Without such an initiative , I promise you that everything to do with economic governance that is on the table will collapse and take the euro with it .
Had we done so we would have avoided the recent stress involving Turkey at NATO and relie@@ ved the burden on our US allies .
With this we can bring the crisis to an end ; with this we can lay the foundation for severely restricting the occurrence of similar crises .
We need a European guarantee for the entire European exclusive economic zone which cannot be con@@ tested by third countries .
We should find out what happened .
Mr President , refugees are probably the most vulnerable populations in the world and , of them , the most vulnerable of the vulnerable are those who can neither return home nor stay in the countries of transit .
The Council itself has already answered this question .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I speak as a former UK Immigration Minister .
The Commission is holding its ground exceptionally well on humanitarian issues , as do , by the way , the Egyptian and Tuni@@ sian authorities and the local population , as well as the international refugee organisations .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Schwa@@ b , the EU &apos;s internal market is a cornerstone of our European cooperation and , as the Commission quite rightly wrote in its draft of the Single Market Act last year , citizens - we Europeans - must be at the centre of the work to develop the single market .
It could be deleted without causing any problems , together with chapter 4 and chapter 5 . In that case , the rest of the proposal and the consultations would not be bad at all .
We need to realise how different the starting points of the various EU countries are in respect of consumer rights .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , that was a very constructive debate in this Chamber , I must say , with all ben@@ ches agreeing that we need to have a better , more constructive , more efficient Consumer Rights Directive than we have today - and also agreeing that while we might not have the perfect one , at least it is better than the existing one which is far from perfect , as everybody agrees .
On the face of it , this looks like a very technical issue .
Between Iran and Israel , the Gulf States would inevitably be the col@@ lateral victims of a conflict .
The successful conclusion of the negotiation process which has been going on for twenty years requires a constructive yet flexible approach from both parties , so that the current , rather rigid positions can be approxim@@ ated .
If the committee does not live up to the hopes invested in it , Parliament should call on the Commission to open a third stage of negotiations .
Moreover , it often interfer@@ es in the u@@ pris@@ ings , without respecting the sovereign laws of the peoples of the region .
The report also takes account of recent changes in the political arena in Bahrain .
I would therefore like to say how pleased I am that the report was adopted , and I hope that cooperation between the European Union and the Per@@ sian Gulf countries will be even more productive in many areas .
The text as it stands does not provide for equal treatment for all workers in terms of working conditions and social rights .
The text adopted today also includes the two main priorities of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ( ALDE ) : it remo@@ ves any reference to additional documents and requests Member States to draw up &apos; cor@@ relation tables &apos; enabling the Commission to verify the transposition of the directive .
Companies are not inc@@ lined to trade in other Member States and consumers are unlikely to award contracts due to the different rules that apply to consumer contracts in the Member States .
Gi@@ ving all EU citizens the opportunity to use digital technology , and ensuring confidence in the Internet and its security , is one of the key objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe .
Other parts of the world , including Europe , should learn lessons from this disaster .
( SV ) Mr President , the number of products covered by this legislation that can be used for both civil and military purposes is far greater than we first thought .
By voting &apos; yes &apos; to the report , we will show that the gu@@ ilt is a crime that is committed against them .
I support the proposals leading to greater awareness and training for people who may come into contact with this form of violence in the course of their work .
Apart from this , agreements of key importance have been reached with regard to the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy as well .
It is an attempt to take advantage of the crisis for a further transfer of sovereignty .
It is therefore possible .
( FR ) Madam President , Mr Van Rompuy , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , the Council &apos;s conclusions on economic policy and the Euro Plus Pact open up a real European P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box , out of which only problems will arise , and European citizens will have to face those problems .
Nature is a stronger force than man can har@@ ness .
Even regarding the social issue , which I now wish to talk to you about , the Commission went to great leng@@ ths to ensure that the 2020 Strategy places more emphasis on social aspects , as well as on education .
This text is an initial step in this direction and I therefore voted in its favour .
It will not be within the power of the affected countries to fund this exclusively from their own sources .
This report is arrogan@@ t and brutal .
According to this report , we need to cater more closely to the needs of women , particularly in non @-@ urban areas .
Each of these applies within the EU .
Given the high volume of trade across the borders of the European Union , the enforcement of EU export controls on dual @-@ use goods must rely on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures .
However , for the same reason , they are also potentially a massive distortion of trade , if their financing operations are not discipl@@ ined by common rules .
There is no doubt that violence against women viol@@ ates their basic rights and fundamental freedoms , in particular the right to security and human dignity .
I voted in favour of this report because I believe it is time that the EU faced this issue and gave good example by means of the legislation and support required to bring an end to violence against women .
These gangs could be comb@@ ated through transnational cooperation between the EU , which is the destination , and these countries , which are the starting point for these gangs .
If this were not the case , I do not think there would be much difference between us and China .
Could you please shed some light on the matter , and tell us what is the European Union &apos;s policy on Gad@@ dafi and Libya ?
( DE ) Madam President , thank you , Mrs Fla@@ š@@ í@@ kov@@ á , for taking my question .
On the issue of Members &apos; salaries , it is not Parliament &apos;s responsibility to update salaries .
We are talking about corruption in the proper sense of the word , whereas mistakes are un@@ inten@@ tional .
The report also offers more important news , namely the implementation of the reporting system for dealing with irregularities , known as IM@@ S .
If you have read the report thoroughly you will also have been able to observe the facts : namely that the Netherlands - I cannot speak for the United Kingdom but I am speaking now on behalf of the Netherlands - is one of those countries with the lowest percentage of fraud , while it is also stressed that , where fraud occurs , it is to be tackled very hard .
That is why I am in favour of and why we have supported the cluster policy - we have around 2 000 of them - which enables connections between research and industry , universities , research and industry and innovation , so as to make our industrial system more competitive .
The agreement provides for mechanisms for controlling catches , for emplo@@ ying of local cre@@ ws , and for a clause relating to suspension or review if cases of human rights violations occur .
Finally , Mr President , I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and coordin@@ ators for their contribution and the business @-@ like collaboration that ensu@@ ed , which , as I hope , will enable us today to adopt resolutions on the Single Market with a convincing majority , and to continue the work of recent years on the development of legislation that will truly consolidate the Single Market and make it the instrument for creating growth and jobs in Europe .
Through the mobility of citizens and , in particular , the recognition of professional qualifications , we can consider further issues concerning European citizens .
We have managed to formulate a compromise , which invites you to move beyond your proposal 25 , and we invite you to move beyond a mere communication , which would not meet the expectations and needs of stakeholders , users and all parties concerned in the public services , and nor would it meet the objectives which , moreover , you are setting .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with the guidelines laid down by this important communication prepared by the European Commission in response to Professor Monti &apos;s report of last May .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very grateful to every one of you for the quality of your speeches across a whole range of views .
Now , other procedural requirements will delay the money &apos;s arrival at its destination even more .
That is why we have been advocating the need to adapt the rules for mobili@@ sing this fund , so as to make its mobilisation more flexible and timely .
It is just a pity that it is over@@ due .
Such an opportunity is very important and necessary because it provides Member States with increased opportunities to stop terrorist networks from operating and to take appropriate preventive measures .
Tourism is an important economic activity in the EU with a high potential for contributing to greater employment and economic growth , as well as to playing an important role in socio @-@ economic integration in rural , peripheral and less @-@ developed areas , such as areas rich in industrial heritage .
I would point out that the EF@@ SA , the European Food Safety Authority , expressed a favourable opinion to extensively indicating the presence of this substance .
I also support the idea that only those parties represented by at least one MEP are eligible for funding .
in writing . - ( RO ) Member States must adopt a firm joint stance in order to improve the functioning of the European Single Market and prevent the return of economic protectionism , which would result in fragmentation of the internal market and affect competitiveness .
They should be offered far more opportunities to become established and to expand within the internal market .
Over the last few days , it has become clear that the Member States want to retain these powers .
First of all , let us remember that there is a world of difference between 50 @-@ year @-@ old reactors in Japan and the new designs under preparation in Europe - a world of difference .
However , what I do not understand is why some people have still not opened their eyes to this topic , even after Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
And I am certain that the Icel@@ an@@ dic people will make a very responsible decision about whether or not to join the European Union .
We all realise that this conflict jeopardis@@ es the accession negotiations with Iceland .
The United Nations Operation in Côte d &apos;@@ Ivoire ( UN@@ O@@ CI ) has now taken action , with support from the French Lic@@ or@@ ne troops and in accordance with the Security Council resolution , but it has done so in order to protect civilians from the heavy weap@@ on@@ ry used by the inc@@ umb@@ ent regime .
Events in Belarus are very clearly a message and wake @-@ up call for the European Union in terms of the responsibilities which it must assume in such cases .
But this policy has to be re@@ designed and that also requires additional financing .
It does not make sense to support democracy in the South by weakening it in the East .
Once again , I would like to thank our rapporteur and to thank the House for its strong support for this measure .
I appeal to the Council not to take issue with the cor@@ relation tables , and if it must , not in this case , so that the new vacc@@ inations can come into force during this season , as expected .
We should make these prospects clear to the people there who want to be part of Europe .
Amendment 10 also proposed that in the case of nuclear power stations in border areas , the local and regional bodies must be involved in the decisions on both sides of the border .
We must draft a European plan to phase out nuclear power forth@@ with .
This fe@@ eb@@ le increase is progres@@ sively distan@@ cing them from the eight Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations in 2000 .
H@@ und@@ reds of government officials , human rights activists and opponents of the regime have been arrested during the last two months .
This is absolutely not what we need at this time : we need to turn around the trend , and this would send completely the wrong signal .
It is important to say that when such cuts were made in the past , without taking into account fleets &apos; partic@@ ul@@ arities , the state of fish stocks in each case and each country &apos;s consumption needs , they did not solve any of the problems with which the sector is now faced .
On both of those issues - to author@@ ise and to ensure availability on both of those issues - there must be a solution to be found and I am certain that it could be found .
It is not a trivi@@ al issue : the spectrum relating to economic activities currently represents 3 % of European gross domestic product ( GDP ) and that is just the start .
They were sentenced to do this for life and to miss out on scho@@ oling .
There are three reasons for my uncertainty .
I should like to emphasise something else : I believe that the effects that such a free trade agreement between two of the gi@@ ants of international trade would have on the entire structure of global trade must be discussed in greater detail than has been the case her@@ eto@@ fore .
However , until such time as it is possible to conclude investment agreements at Union level , a legal vacuum - the legal uncertainty referred to by Mr Cas@@ par@@ y - needs to be avoided and the necessary security of law must exist for European investors .
The seven discharge proposals concern seven very important European institutions .
However , we in Leg@@ a Nord shall fight until the end to preserve and develop this valuable resource for our territories .
Nevertheless , it is important to be at pa@@ ins to guarantee better cooperation , lin@@ k@@ up and coordination with the competent institutions in the Member States , by promoting syn@@ ergies and better circulation of information .
This agency should , however , make efforts to improve its planning and monitoring policies .
I regret that the Court of Auditors was comp@@ elled to comment on the budgetary and financial statement of the Foundation , especially to the effect that the initial provisional accounts presented by the Foundation contained serious shortcomings , pointing to significant weaknesses in the financial organisation of the Foundation ; welcomes the Foundation &apos;s confirmation that it will ensure , through additional training and resources , that its implementation of year @-@ end procedures and its adher@@ ence to the deadlines for the presentation of its accounts is correct
in writing . - ( BG ) I defend the privileges and immunity of Bruno G@@ oll@@ nisch and I think that the persecution he is being subjected to is of a purely political nature .
It has therefore closely followed all the measures approved by the FAO , playing an active and constructive role , not least in drawing up the agreement adopted at the 36@@ th session of the FAO Conference held in Rome 18 @-@ 23 November 2009 .
I did vote in favour of the motion for a resolution , as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is raised many times .
Neg@@ ative effects of the trade preferences cannot therefore be ruled out , which is why I rejected the report .
in writing . - ( RO ) Investment agreements are still mandatory for Member States following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Func@@ tioning of the European Union and they must be dealt with under the EU &apos;s exclusive competence in the area of direct foreign investments .
Accordingly , the Council may be able to con@@ quer its internal resistance .
It is another step in the right direction because openness and transparency are at the heart of the democratic decision @-@ making process and we should be made aware of all of those who influence and sometimes have an un@@ due influence on policy , procedures and outcomes .
The nuclear accident in Chernobyl is still having disastrous effects on the populations of both Ukraine and neighbouring countries .
Baroness Lud@@ ford , you have had your answer .
We hope that the Commission will pay special attention to these issues in its report .
We will examine this matter in depth in order to provide clear rules , prevent misleading information and facilitate responsible choices by consumers when purchasing textile products .
The proposal we will vote on tomorrow differs significantly from that put forward by the European Commission , which mainly consi@@ sted in technical changes simplifying legislation already in force .
rapporteur . - ( NL ) Mr President , the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection stands for free trade and against protectionism .
It would execute numerous tasks , such as checking the investigation systems in place in Member States and coordinating controls and inspections , but no proposal was put forward .
Ladies and gentlemen , an intergovernmental solution is no longer the right approach to foreign affairs , security and defence : instead , we need more Europe .
We propose that Parliament should enter into a strategic dialogue with the European Council , which we call on to discuss Parliament &apos;s recommendations , to draw up a proper foreign policy strategy and to devote an extraordinary meeting to European security and defence .
Either these countries will look only to China or to Russia , or they will at least have a chance to look towards Europe .
The coordination of 27 different foreign and security policies is not the easiest of tasks , and you cannot blame the captain alone for the ship@@ w@@ reck .
I believe that the European Union &apos;s own military capabilities will also provide assistance to our US and NATO allies , both in a political and military sense , especially with regard to our close neighbours .
In general , there is a policy of double standards protecting the economic interests of European arms manufacturers , which have made millions by selling arms to dict@@ ators who have subsequently used them to mass@@ acre their own people and those of neighbouring states .
Israel &apos;s initial response to the reconciliation , with@@ holding Palestinian Authority ( P.@@ A. ) taxes , is illegal and potentially catastrophic for peace , putting at risk the state @-@ building efforts of Prime Minister Sal@@ em Fa@@ y@@ y@@ ad .
This report hypo@@ critically names social un@@ rest as one element of a new generation of security challenges and risks .
It is therefore a useful source of information when foodstuffs are the subject of dispute or constitute a health haz@@ ard for consumers .
in writing . - As I understand , the report contains a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approxim@@ ation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement .
A kind of permanent suspicion has long surrounded MEPs &apos; relationships with interest representatives , hence the creation of a first register of lobby@@ ists in 1996 .
In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , many across the party lines stressed the importance of the Council becoming part of the system .
I voted in favour of this report because the Council &apos;s annual report provides a consistent overview of the direction and actions of the common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) .
I voted in favour of this report as the Council &apos;s annual report provides a clear view of the policies and actions of the EU &apos;s common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) and contributes to strengthening interinstitutional dialogue .
Turkey is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) and of the Western European Union ( W@@ EU ) .
in writing . - Three of our six amendments were adopted : the one calling for separate budget lines on common security and defence policy missions , the one calling on the Council and the Vice @-@ President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to overcome the imbalance between civilian and military planning capabilities , and the one on the urgency of addressing water management issues in Central Asia .
The impression one gets from this report , or indeed from others on the same subject or on foreign policy , is that the intention is to push the European Union into ensuring that it gradually gains the upper hand over the Member States in drawing up foreign and defence policy .
The recent Euro @-@ row over action in Libya and the subsequent German opt @-@ out made it clear to the rest of the world that the EU is still not able to project a real common foreign and security policy .
In this regard , I would like to highlight point 12 of the report - the first step towards coordinated , effective action from Member States in the Security Council .
Brussels is seeking to impose European diplomacy and security and defence policies , but is failing : not for want of funding , but rather because the rationale and assu@@ mp@@ tions underp@@ inning the approach are still wrong .
Another issue , especially during times of crisis , is that SMEs are affected by the delay from public institutions in sett@@ ling their invo@@ ices .
The mid @-@ term review is also important because the problems of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises - the difficulties of obtaining funding , the size of administrative burdens , over@@ regulation and market access problems - appear to be becoming permanent .
I am thus calling on you to show resolve in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council ( Ecofin ) next week .
If we take a more far @-@ sighted approach , the Arab spring is also very important .
In conclusion , a few days ago , the President of the European Council , Mr Van Rompuy , stated that Europeans are not innovative because they are de@@ pressed .
I believe that businesses and the citizens are watching on .
Mrs Pack has already made reference to this , saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them , such as the EU@@ N@@ IC network of national institutes for culture , must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy .
( SK ) Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Development for the report on un@@ locking the potential of cultural and creative industries , I consider it important that the cultural and creative industries have been recognised as an instrument for local and regional development .
Three hours ago , Mr Mart@@ í@@ nez Mart@@ í@@ nez made a statement about this .
We also support the call for the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public / private partnerships is balanced , including trade uni@@ on@@ ists and representatives of the business community , in particular , SMEs , and that they work in a transparent manner .
To that end , I advocate better coherence between common trade policy and practices in Member States accepting exceptionally low bi@@ ds from companies whose countries are not signat@@ ories to the Agreement on Government Pro@@ cu@@ rement ( G@@ PA ) , to the disadvantage of companies from EU Member States .
Little by little , red tape and legislation - which , until recently , ni@@ pped in the bu@@ d the development of innovative small companies - has been stri@@ pped away and young people are starting to see a gli@@ mmer of a stable future that is hopefully full of opportunities .
According to the conclusions of the 2009 European Innovation Panel , the recent economic and financial crisis has had disproportionate effects in different countries .
As someone who , for many years , worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job , this matter is of particular importance to me .
Ladies and gentlemen , Commission , Council , it is time to stop the words and the appeals - it is time for action .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Leinen for a long over@@ due regulation .
The next item is the Commission statement on the selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro .
( EL ) Mr President , I absolutely agree with the rapporteur on all five points of his proposals on so @-@ called rating agencies and the exagger@@ ated impact which they have on the global economy and on the European economy .
We only regret that Parliament does not feel that some of its resolutions on programming were respected in every detail , although the Commission has taken full account of Parliament &apos;s view wherever possible .
The German authorities accepted the Commission proposal to dispat@@ ch to Germany experts in epide@@ mi@@ ology of food @-@ borne diseases from the Commission , the EC@@ DC and the EF@@ SA .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , the health dimension of the crisis resulting from this outbreak of E@@ H@@ EC bacteria is absolutely tragic .
The people of my home area fear new cases every day .
She cannot ignore her responsibilities .
Here too , Mr K@@ allas , it will be up to the Commission to play a key role .
However , the way to overcome the objections and to pa@@ ve the way for the acceptance and effic@@ acy of the framework of the Euro@@ vig@@ nette is to ensure , firstly , that the directive is applied strictly , transpar@@ ently and quickly to all the Member States and , secondly , that all the revenue is chann@@ elled , as contribut@@ ory resources , to transport infrastructures and is not used to plug well @-@ public@@ ised gaps .
The first one is the utilisation of revenues , and I would like to return to the comment made by Mr Sterckx .
Croatia will be linked to the European Information Network on Dru@@ gs and Dru@@ g Ad@@ diction ( RE@@ IT@@ O@@ X ) and will share data with the EM@@ CD@@ DA , subject to the data protection requirements of the Union and national law .
If we are to achieve these objectives , however , we need adequate funding for research and development , which has been scar@@ ce until now .
In this respect , the report highlights the need to strengthen dialogue with the European Commission at the different negotiation stages and in the monitoring of agreements in force .
L@@ ess poll@@ uting vehicles will remain exempt .
I endorsed adoption of the directive .
The Darfur people deserve to achieve what they have been lon@@ ging for for so long - lasting peace and justice .
Now we see a light at the end of the tunnel .
At the same time , the authorities have focused particular attention on the fight against corruption .
Just recently , Commissioner Malmström presented a package for combating corruption that we can use as a basis for further work .
( RO ) Mr President , the report we have before us today is objective and fair , highlighting that Romania and Bulgaria are fully prepared technically to join the Schengen area .
The Schengen Agreement is already opening all the doors to Europe to organised crime and illegal immigration .
To promote national political agen@@ das at the expense of the aspirations of EU citizens of Bulgarian and Romanian origin is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
We have a financial mechanism to improve the management of these flows at the European level and to strengthen the solidarity between Member States .
Make it fairer , make it more transparent , or secure own resources for the EU .
I therefore also think that it is necessary for us to have this possibility of a 5 % rise , so that there is the opportunity for new policy areas and for meeting new demands , as well as for investing in transport , energy and research - areas that the EU must invest in in future .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue @-@ card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
The report has also persu@@ aded me that European solidarity should be strengthened by the creation of intermediate regions in order to ensure that the cohesion policy provides fair coverage for the whole of Europe .
We would have the resources for investment in research and development , fighting climate change and in building solidarity between the regions of the EU .
These recommendations result in an increase in transport costs , and hau@@ liers with older vehicles will obviously be in a worse situation .
( DA ) Mr President , we have today voted on and adopted in Parliament a decision recognising that Romania and Bulgaria are ready for admission into the Schengen cooperation .
( IT ) Mr President , research and innovation play a central role in the European Union &apos;s development and competitiveness and they are crucial in terms of reaching the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy .
This must be used to achieve more ambitious goals set by the EU .
Child labour and the organised violation of human rights must not be ignored when trade agreements are under discussion and the EU must take a strong position in promoting social policy and labour and social standards in trade negotiations .
in writing . - I voted against the introduction of EU contract law as I do not believe Brussels should be making legislation where national legislation already exists .
A problem for the development of these applications and for completing the systems on time may be a lack of investment .
Our concerns are mainly about the speed with which some wish to pursue this , despite the numerous questions we still have .
I am voting for this report in that it presents suitable political priorities for Parliament for the Multi@@ annual Financial Framework , in both legislative and budgetary terms .
If we want to achieve this ambitious goal , I believe that the financial resources the EU has need to be just as ambitious .
Against this background , we believe that the key priorities for the next M@@ FF should be group@@ ed around the following themes : knowledge for growth and employment , sustainable development , cohesion for growth and employment , citizenship and Global Europe .
The Europe 2020 strategy should be the implementation reference for the M@@ FF .
The position adopted by Parliament today is the first victory in the battle over the shape of the new financial perspective for the period 2014 @-@ 2020 .
I am referring to Article d for Mr Weber &apos;s benefit .
They are threatening the independence of the courts ; they have already s@@ nat@@ ched the independence of the media .
The left wing simply has to accept that this decision cannot be changed either in Brussels , or in Strasbourg .
Is this another case of T@@ ory double @-@ speak , where they speak out against the acts of the European Union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament ?
Right now , we are calling on Russia to respect obligations it has undertaken in the context of the Council of Europe , the United Nations and the OSCE regarding free and fair elections , and to cooperate well with O@@ DI@@ HR to ensure appropriate monitoring .
The main forum for addressing human rights and rule @-@ of @-@ law issues is the European Union @-@ Russia human rights consultations .
As my fellow Members have already said , at least three years have passed , three years during which these people , these hu@@ st@@ lers , as they have rightly been called by numerous fellow Members - and I am with them - are misleading colleagues and are misleading small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which are the back@@ bone of the European economy .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Do you also believe that this was not very helpful to Mr O@@ ett@@ inger who is committed to introducing more stringent stress tests ?
That is not true .
Germany has been mentioned several times and , of course , we will have to live with the criticism .
I have two questions .
This would provide a clear statement that this cannot be a national issue , but must be a European issue , the aim being to ensure the safety of European citizens .
Other business
It is essential that foreign aid and foreign policy remain the remit of individual Member States and is not dict@@ ated at EU level , even if the recipient is in need and appropriate .
So , as well as holding this debate , we also have something else to do - to say clearly : the door is open , do not worry .
The economic governance package , country @-@ specific recommendations and the stability mechanisms : this is how Europe should seriously draw the lessons from the crisis and act upon them .
However , everything is just continuing as before .
I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter .
To succeed in finally making the United States of Europe available to us will require leadership not only from the national governments but primarily from the European institutions .
The Council &apos;s decision will send an extremely strong signal to the Western Balkans as a whole , encouraging the governments in this region to continue their reforms .
I have also paid close attention to your proposals on market measures .
In my opinion , this was another fundamental point .
Agr@@ o @-@ environmental measures should be easy to apply , should be flan@@ ked by adequate counter@@ balances and should not create any additional administrative burden .
If we fail to handle the demographic changes and make rural areas more attractive to young farmers , we run the risk , within a certain period of time , of this situation becoming a real obstacle preventing stable , high @-@ quality agricultural production .
I must also offer a very special word of thanks to the various shadow rapporteurs who have helped us in our work .
That is why we can send our citizens a very clear message right now .
When it comes to putting into practice rules that we have agreed on together , we cannot start making exceptions .
Mr President , Europe is currently in crisis : there is a financial crisis , a macroeconomic crisis , a social crisis and a moral crisis .
It is a pity that there is a lack of information about the specific effects of spending this money , because in fact it is research evaluating the way in which the whole region has used a variety of programmes , and not evaluation of individual programmes , which should suggest the way forward for cohesion policy in future years .
And we will continue these negotiations and continue this fight , so he can count on us .
Finally , greater coordination is needed between regional policy and the common agricultural policy in rural areas .
The Commission &apos;s negotiating position was based , among other things , on the results of an ex @-@ post evaluation of the current protocols carried out by external experts .
However , in order to realise these objectives , territorial cooperation programmes will have to be simplified , and local authorities and the public will need to be more involved by encouraging better communication through a large @-@ scale media and awareness @-@ raising campaign .
If a country like Belgium wishes to ensure that Europe is not allowed to make decisions on Belgium &apos;s behalf in the future , then it is high time to demand that those responsible for federal policy should recognise their responsibilities to their citizens , instead of interven@@ ing with the Commission for the retention of the index or of social policy in Belgium .
It includes concepts that are innovative , such as rever@@ sed qualified majority voting and the fin@@ ing of Member States , and ensures that national budgets are no longer a matter merely for national parliaments .
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance tried to introduce key amendments asking for the use of Euro@@ bonds , fiscal convergence and the application of a cap on financial sanctions and other incentives .
The European Parliament &apos;s proposals pa@@ ve the way for an environment of economic stability , while at the same time allowing for the development of innovative action mechanisms , such as Euro@@ bonds and European project bonds .
I am voting against this report .
This signal could act as a guarantee against the risk of collapse of the euro area .
Thus , it is necessary to provide the required time period and adopt measures that allow manufactures to sell trac@@ tors , to seek resources for research and that also allow farmers to replace their trac@@ tors with less poll@@ uting ones , always with the aim of complying with European environmental legislation .
I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2011 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed , and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations .

We can , however , do a lot to improve energy efficiency . In Finland , for example , there are currently enormous quantities of wood , of waste wood , which nobody uses .
Otherwise the whole of this can have no effect and the Customs 2000 programme will just be another document worked out by the Commission and the Council of Ministers .
But I do not want to open up the debate on this issue , given the balance of opinion in the House .
Under the pretext that zero inflation is virtually in@@ achiev@@ able in a period of economic growth , some economists have always believed that the official policy should be one of low inflation .
I was deeply up@@ set at seeing a joint European programme of measures against drug abuse almost distorted beyond recognition by fellow Members who have given up the battle in the face of drug producers and those in favour of a liberal drugs policy .
Mr President , Mr Bur@@ tone &apos;s report contains a number of different parts .
I wonder whether Mr Kin@@ kel has forgotten that we are in the third year after Maastricht .
Mr President , I did not quite understand why the order of the reports was changed .
After all , the proof of the pu@@ dding is in the eating , as they say , so I would like a detailed reply from the Commission on this fundamental question .
D@@ isch@@ arge is also proposed concerning the European Co@@ al and Steel Community and the European Foundation for the Impro@@ vement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin , based on the reports of Mr Bla@@ k and Mr Kel@@ le@@ tt @-@ Bow@@ man , respectively .
It very much depends on the answer to Mr Titley &apos;s second question as to how far we wish to go in carrying out the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty by trying to frame a common defence policy which may , as he rightly quot@@ es , lead to a common defence .
Indeed , at present , there are technical conditions for the creation of a European health document which can be accepted by all Member States and by the various health system sectors .

All the WHO recommendations are due to be discussed again next week , in full and in detail , by the Veter@@ inary Stand@@ ing Committee , which will examine the WHO recommendations and decide what conclusions should be drawn from them in terms of Community measures .
Do you not agree , Commissioner , that in the long run , it would be wis@@ er to abandon intervention in the case of British beef ?
I accepted a considerable number of amendments in committee , since I believe that a European Parliament resolution on a subject as important as this must be able to count on the support of a substantial majority of Members .
The international money markets are supposed to achieve this by pen@@ alizing governments with high interest rates , currency de@@ valuation or the flight of capital if they pursue mistaken policies , in other words policies that seem to the markets to be infl@@ ationary , or , now that most of us are implementing anti @-@ infl@@ ationary policies , ones that do not seem sufficiently so in the eyes of the markets .
Is the Commission looking at this side of the argument at all .
On the one hand it has presented a proposal for a directive , on the other hand we have the notice on competition rules in the postal sector .
The only thing is , the European Parliament has been adopting good reports for years , it has put forward numerous proposals and called on many occasions on the Council and the Member States not just to make sol@@ em@@ n declarations of intent but to take real measures to combat the growing racism and anti @-@ sem@@ iti@@ sm in the EU .
It should dev@@ ise , support , and sometimes itself hold courses aimed mainly at teachers and youth leaders , dissemin@@ ate knowledge on what feeds racism , anti @-@ Sem@@ iti@@ sm and xenophobia and how such phenomena can best be counter@@ ed and comb@@ ated .
Those who take this line are no true friends of the Arab world .
There therefore appears to be a serious discrepan@@ cy between the national authorities &apos; policy of tolerance and the application of that policy by the local authorities .
For the municipal government of Zagreb too , a solution must be found which is politically sound and which respects the outcome of democratic elections .
Then Mr Tu@@ d@@ j@@ man , the President , has still not appointed a mayor previously put forward by a majority of the people of Zagreb ; there is poor cooperation with the International Tribunal , there are still serious problems in connection with the return of Serbs and in this respect laws have been approved in Zagreb and are also often applied , the direct effect of which is that return is made impossible .
Too many general statements with very little commitment and too few specific priorities .
Finally , Amendment No 4 re@@ inst@@ ates the prohibition against Member States adding taxes to the licence fee .
The point that this Council proposal would have benefited from better cooperation and above all from parliamentary assent has already been adequately ex@@ po@@ unded .
So when we went through the first reading we made some substantial statements and some substantial progress .
The negotiations on the Berlin mandate have scarcely begun , however .
It seems to me that we need more information on this link in order to be able to develop an appropriate reduction strategy .
Mr Blokland is quite right when he says that if we , the industri@@ alized countries of the European Union , cannot get anything done , then we really cannot expect the developing countries to do anything either .
Mr President , honourable colleagues .
The euro will also put an end to currency fluctuations , and on this point I share many of the concerns expressed this morning .
A few days ago the President of the Commission , Jacques Santer , drew attention once again to the Member States &apos; responsibility for pursuing an active policy on employment , but he cyn@@ ically failed to mention that these EMU convergence criteria are precisely what has eliminated the necessary political room for manoeuvre .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Pé@@ ry on her thorough and disc@@ erning analysis of the causes of the serious crisis currently affecting the Community &apos;s fishing industry .
It is my understanding , moreover , that in the latest round of negotiations between Canada and the European Union , Canada continued to insist that it had a complete right to manage certain stocks exclusively and absolutely - cod , for example - in international waters . This is a fresh sign of its intention to take action outside the 200 @-@ mile limit , in violation of the International Law of the Sea .
The three multi @-@ annual guidance programmes have all failed to allow Member States to reduce their fishing fleets .
Law@@ yers have until now belonged to this category , since there have naturally been restrictions on the practice of the legal profession because of the differences between legal systems .
In order to make smaller firms more aware of standards and facilitate their application , we are working closely with an association created by small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , whose brief is to ensure that these standards are known and complied with during the production process .
In other words , ladies and gentlemen , I can say with some certainty that the number of projects which the European Union will be able to fund under the VI@@ II@@ th EDF will probably will half as much again as those funded under the VI@@ I@@ th Fund .
There is the so @-@ called Dutch clause - Article 22 of the merger regulation - which allows national authorities to take a case before the Commission even if the figure does not reach the threshold .
It is not often that I agree with Mr Met@@ ten , but I was really impressed by his speech this evening .

In order to provide equality of opportunity for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , this directive must be implemented within a reasonable time .
I must say a word in response to Mrs St@@ en@@ ius @-@ Kau@@ kon@@ en , who gave me a slightly mixed score on the amendments .
This is the first annual report by the European Ombudsman .
Thus the report illustrates who can complain - citizens or residents - against whom - the institutions and bodies of the Community - and here we can note that the Ombudsman himself constitutes a further body of the Community .
I , also , agree that , for these reasons , the institution must be given publicity and made more widely known .
I am looking for their bann@@ ers , their stream@@ ers , and I see nothing at all .
I also consider it very important that we re@@ confirm our full commitment to this continued humanitarian presence , to be demonstrated in two ways : first of all by guaranteeing that European aid will continue to arrive directly with the population and , secondly , by ensuring that the staff of the humanitarian organizations enjoy adequate protection .
We should take every care to avoid duplication of work and costs .
It would be desirable for the Commission to complete its proposal by adding a searching analysis of the world and European markets and of the strengths and weaknesses of European undertakings .
The G7 states now account for 46 % of world production .
Just among ourselves , Mr Santer : does the fact that your European employment strategy is being interpreted as conc@@ ur@@ rent with their views and deser@@ ving of support precisely by the senior advocates of deregulation and cuts in social services not give you much cause for doubt and anxiety ?
The European Parliament , in its joint resolution following the Florence summit , stresses the responsibility of Europeans to concern themselves with a whole series of problems , in Europe and elsewhere .
Now for employment .
There are no incentives for the job creation proposals which the Commission and Parliament really wanted .
Of course what it should have said is that it does not intend putting any further money into the European Union budget and , in fact , wants money back .
Employment is not generated only by investment in the trans@@ European networks - tar@@ m@@ acking is not governing - it is generated above all by the institutional capacity to apply tor@@ sion to the entire Community machine , ge@@ aring up the value added by employment and social cohesion .
We still lack a firm tim@@ esc@@ ale as to how the EU will achieve these objectives .
It was un@@ balanced , incomplete and bi@@ ased .
The Commission and this Parliament have moved on .
As rapporteur of the committee responsible , I want to discuss six points .
Sixth point : if legislation is to be simplified , it is essential to operate systematically on the basis of a check @-@ list , which must become an indispensable part of the preparation of a new legislative proposal as also of the review of existing legislation .
What we need is innovative techniques that combine the use of several renewable energy sources .
What about calling it Mo@@ bil ?
That is not what the European Parliament wants !
Every child not born in the West makes a considerably greater contribution to saving natural resources than every child not born in the developing countries .
Such links , such networks serve to promote cooperation and must incorporate support for those bodies which have the most direct contact with the actual business world , such as cham@@ bers of commerce , trade guil@@ ds and the like .
One alternative is of course mobility of labour , which however also causes social problems .
In 1994 , the Ecofin Council held that , in certain circumstances , the loans granted could be the subject of interest @-@ rate subsidies financed from the Community budget .
A success story for them but hardly for Europe !
The Commission is proposing to amend Directive 93 / 38 / EEC in such a way that all the proposed modifications , with the exception of the new statistical requirements , would apply to research and development services , public undertakings , and private undertakings operating on the basis of a special or exclusive right - such as a conc@@ ession - in all the sectors covered by the directive , including the four referred to , which are not covered by the G@@ PA : gas and heat distribution ; extraction of oil and gas ; transport by railway other than urban railway ; and telecommunications .
I think that wine @-@ based cocktails and drinks arom@@ ati@@ zed with wine products are now being recognised as traditional in certain markets and for certain consumers .
This interest was confirmed by the vote at the last meeting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
At Parliament &apos;s request , the common position includes the possibility for Member States to take measures to ensure an adequate level of social protection and respect for national social legislation .
Second , the Commission can accept , in principle , subject to some re@@ drafting , Nos 7 , 11 , 15 , 17 , 20 , 21 , 30 , 33 and 36 .
H@@ und@@ reds of their relatives in Belgium and the Netherlands are now m@@ our@@ ning their loss .
I should like to make one final comment on my report . A number of amendments have been tabled with a view to having freedom of movement for third @-@ country nationals included in my report as well .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the actual date by which freedom of movement in Europe ought to have been made a reality was 1 January 1993 .
I therefore wish to offer Mr Pi@@ ec@@ y@@ k very warm congratulations .
Thus the Brenner Tunnel project , which is so important to Austria , is also called into question .
I shall therefore be voting in favour of the joint text drawn up by the conciliation committee , and I hope that many others here will do the same .
What tests are being referred to ?
For the moment the money is not in place and , as I have said , there are quite substantial conditions that have to be fulfilled .
It therefore recently published , for the first time , a brochure on women as players in regional development , so as to demonstrate what can be successfully achieved in the various countries and regions of the Community .
But the real challenge for the Irish presidency will be to get concrete results so that these aspirations are not left as empty sen@@ timents .

The European Union must tigh@@ ten its cooperation with all the States of Europe and must promote pan @-@ European integration by exploiting , inter alia , the possibilities offered by the OSCE and the Council of Europe .
The objectives of achieving strong , sustainable economic growth and increasing the employment intensity of that growth are receiving considerable attention , not only in the broad economic policy guidelines , but also in the wider work of the Commission and the European Council .
But we need to keep our attention focused on the employment objective and to intensify the debate on the most appropriate policy responses which cover a very broad spectrum of actions .
I am sure the honourable Member from Northern Ireland who placed this question heard me unequi@@ vo@@ cally answer the question that he has put .
Proce@@ edings on the proposal for a regulation are taking their course and the matter is still before the Council .
As far as the 1997 budget is concerned , there are signs that it is indeed a question of not wanting to .
As the Commissioner well knows , the UK &apos;s op@@ ting out of the social protocol has this year already blocked execution of the budget line concerning transnational meetings of workers &apos; and employers &apos; representatives ; as in the case of the preliminary draft budget for 1997 , the executive committee is therefore proposing to divide the line in the amending budget , with the specific intention of distingu@@ ishing meetings involving representatives of four@@ teen Member States from those involving representatives of all fifteen Member States .
We therefore expect that this will be taken into consideration for the 15 Member States in the corresponding column .
He has improved procedures .
Our group , naturally , as you will have realized , is going to reject his report .
This whole process suggests that we are being drawn into something we prevented last year : the Commission is cutting back on funds for development policy in order to promote what I would call a milit@@ ari@@ zed foreign policy .
It is also essential to emphasize that human experiments must never be performed in return for payment , because any commerci@@ alization of the human body is in@@ admissible ; and the same should apply to donations of organs and tissue .

It is important that such freedom be established in Algeria and in some other States , where freedom of the press is being seriously violated .

I am not going to repeat the words of the statement I made on behalf of the Commission , but I have taken careful note of Mrs Schro@@ ed@@ ter &apos;s statement which I will pass on to the responsible Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
Most particularly it seeks to do that by imposing sanctions on individuals and companies who contra@@ ven@@ e the US law .
Which services does the Commission de@@ em essential ?
Like you , too , we believe that the debate on the form of organization and legal nature of those public services is an obsolete debate .
For that reason , I have produced more a strategic report than one that just looks at 1994 in isolation , given that 1994 is now ancient history as far as many people here are concerned .
Therefore , what remains of concern to us is not in the main the contents or analysis within the report but what it says and does not say about the performance of the structural funds programmes themselves .
The motion for a resolution and the opinions of the committees raise some important questions of principle in relation to structural policy , which go beyond the brief and the time @-@ span of a single annual report .
Another problem in the Portuguese programme has been that of monitoring and evaluation .
We must try to draw some conclusions in addition to those pointed out by other colleagues .
As this is to a large extent regulated by other measures , we have chosen to refer to those measures in the re@@ port@@ .@@ 3.@@ The environment is important in this context , not least the fact that improved safety is also good from an environmental point of view .
That is part of the frustration of our committee of inquiry .
We do not have time for me to go through the six specific questions I asked but I have to say that my luck with the Commissioner is rather like my luck with the United Kingdom lot@@ tery .
Certainly they now accept them and the democratic norms which exist in the EU .

I have no doubt this is true in each country of the European Union but I , as a British Member , am happy to pay tribute to the very high standards and the leadership that the BBC has given in public service broadcasting .
There are already a number of things in train which are addressing some of these issues .
These basic ideas lead to conclusions that are completely at vari@@ ance with the demands of the future .
These studies are likely to be completed by the end of the year , and we shall issue an early communication on the basis of their findings , so that we can then decide , with Parliament , on a sensible way of resolving this matter as well .
We , of course , are the elected body and , sadly , you are not , although you received our endor@@ sement when we agreed to the appointment of this present Commission .
I would point out , however , that Article 9 ( 1 ) , of the common position poses a real problem for those who engage in fal@@ con@@ ry .
This represents a prior step before embark@@ ing on the re@@ drafting of those directives - since it seems clear that the Commission either could not find sufficient reason for undertaking this task or encountered significant technical problems with it .
I should like to thank everyone , including the interpreters , and remind you that our next sitting will be held tomorrow at 9 a.m .
The first , about the matter of Bosnia , is withdrawn because it is dealt with elsewhere .
Our group is a great advocate of respect for people , solidarity and freedom , values that cannot continue to exist if the social fabric is tor@@ n , or if exclusion results in the margin@@ alisation of millions of people .
It will then be possible to do something about child labour , to improve environmental protection and to make proposals to reduce global speculation .
Why is German not also being used ?
Numerous European Councils have stressed their priorities and the Commission remains convinced of their importance , as I understood the presidency does also .
It is extremely urgent to resolve the conflict by means of financial and material incentives and the creation of an administrative institution responsible for ensuring a continuous dialogue .
It set out three conditions : democrati@@ zation , release of the Kurdish de@@ pu@@ ties , an end to the war and a political solution to the Kurdish question .
This Parliament agreed to Customs Union and now bears a special responsibility .
In this Chamber , we have heard an unexpected phar@@ is@@ a@@ ism , namely that we should be careful lest , by any chance , since Greece is a Member of the European Union , it might be considered that a stern attitude towards Turkey is motivated by p@@ hil@@ h@@ ellen@@ ic parti@@ ality .
Regarding tobacco , the Committee on Agriculture felt that something of a fiscal pause was desirable , but above all it op@@ poses any change in the method of calcul@@ ating excise duties .
Mr President , it was very exciting to sit on the committee during this work , because the issue in question is a very significant one , both from the point of view of economic policy and in many other respects .
However , the fact is of course that not much direct Union funding has been available , for example , to deal with the main difficult problems , when one bears in mind that at present the worst funding problems of all lie precisely in the fields of obtaining equity capital and venture capital and - in my country at least - excessive cau@@ ti@@ ousness on the part of the banks when it comes to extending credit .
I undertake the commitment to make every effort to increase the Commission &apos;s contribution towards reducing bureaucracy and improving the relevant legislation , to simplify the administrative environment .
This should be done bearing in mind the interests of users .
These intim@@ i@@ dat@@ ory and pro@@ voc@@ ative measures directed against the movement that I represent demonstrate the determination of the State to rise rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ d over all democratic rights .
But where it comes to this simplification there is still a lot to be done .
If the public have got information they will be able to make much more practical use of that hot @-@ line . Also , regarding cooperation - cooperation between the Community and national governments , and between national governments and other national governments .
En@@ ding up empty @-@ handed does not suggest sh@@ re@@ w@@ d stat@@ es@@ manship .
The job of the EU must be to support the cooperation which is already taking place and which is now growing spontane@@ ously between the peoples and not to automatically create new structures .
The remainder of my remarks will be confined to the beef proposal and your request for amendments .
We know well enough what you are aiming at : Singapore is in preparation , the major 1999 negotiations are in preparation , and you are preparing to challenge the great 1992 agreement on the CAP .
We also have reason to be satisfied with the specific activities that have hitherto taken place within the framework of E@@ DI@@ COM .
The Commission will devote itself to taking forward , in close cooperation with the Member States and the two sides of industry , the pact &apos;s recommendations on this point .
This is the kind of institutional reform that the Union needs !
We have at present 47 items in the budget which do not have a formal legal base .
We want to make sure that we have a presence around the world - in Latin America , Asia and elsewhere - and so the Foreign Affairs Committee endor@@ ses the focus on those areas .
On that we will be ret@@ abling a very few amendments to re@@ inst@@ ate the preliminary draft budget figures on democracy and human rights programmes in the PHARE programme , in the TACIS programme and in the MEDA programme .
The Council &apos;s attitude here is utterly wrong and should be c@@ ensured at the highest level , beginning with a clear @-@ cut re@@ bu@@ ke from Parliament and its President .
However , the Council is not listening to Parliament .
I wish to compli@@ ment him on the attitude that he has taken towards those companies since he became a Commissioner .
But the Commission is well aware that the funds available are insufficient and that the Ministers of Finance refused to add anything .
And no doubt each member of the Council will claim it was the other States that did not want it .
Therefore , we will accept the principle of a framework directive and we will also accept the dimin@@ ution in our powers under Article 13@@ 0s .
Can I ask the Commissioner , when she responds to the debate , please to give us some indication on tim@@ esc@@ ale .
Mr President , I just want to place on record my thanks to my colleague for defending my honour and also thank the Commission .
The chosen formula for open exchanges without conclusions was a good one even though , I know , it may be frustr@@ ating in many respects because no specific decisions were taken .
Nat@@ am@@ y@@ c@@ in can be obtained from pharmac@@ ies as a remedy for such things as infl@@ amm@@ ation of the eyes or of the internal female sexual organs .
In a letter to the Committee on the Environment , Mrs B@@ jer@@ rega@@ ard has promised to comply with these demands .
Par@@ tly by virtue of its culture which has been strongly influenced by Western Christian@@ ity , Slovenia is an obvious candidate for membership .
Finally , we note the absence of any sign of goodwill by the Sloven@@ ians towards their neighbours regarding some form of accommodation over the dumping policy practi@@ sed by the Slovenian duty @-@ free shops , which has such disastrous effects on small traders in the border region .
The EU has a historic chance to encourage real democracy in Russia and to support the peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chechnya .
It is not sufficient in a world where capital now flows freely across borders .
I am convinced that if this committee has no indicators at its disposal it will remain at most a paper tiger and at most capable of producing re@@ ams of paper .
That is what led me to ask the question .
The Council has made it clear repeatedly - and continue to do so - that observ@@ ance of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms is an essential element for closer relations between Turkey and the European Union .
The presidency will also bring under scrutiny the present arrangements for joint customs surveillance operations at the external frontier . This examination will be with a view to improving their efficiency .
Mr President , first I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the excellent work done on their respective reports .
The difficult question facing the European Union is how to react to these developments .
The report agrees with and accepts basically the fundamental material in the Commission programme , but many of the amendments proposed in it will add to and en@@ rich it .
This is a hypo@@ critical budget heading , given the environmental damage that we cause in our own countries .
We behave as if we had full employment in the EU .
This is not going to happen now , Commissioner , and we thank you but in the future we must not allow the tension between the two po@@ les to be too great or in@@ compatibility will be inevitable .
We view those two features of the SA@@ VE programme as very important .
Can we put it any more clearly ?
Look at the restrictions that are being imposed on children &apos;s programmes , on advertising medicinal products , advertisements that off@@ end philosophical beliefs , controls on advertising time .
However , Mr President , Commissioner , these logi@@ cs are bound to cross over and merge .
We all have a shared concern for the future of television - the most influential medium in our democracy .
( The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Vig@@ orous support for job @-@ creating small and medium @-@ sized enterprises from the European Union , and especially the Council of Ministers , is certainly a logical step - particularly since this sector is repeatedly portra@@ yed by the Council as the Union &apos;s most important generator of employment .
In conjunction with the trade unions , we oppose these mu@@ til@@ ative re@@ locations and we call for new rights , nation@@ ally and on a community level , for paid employees , so that they can safeguard their assets , defend their jobs and control the use of public funds granted to companies .
There was a difficult vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this particular report which in the end was a straight left / right divide .
There are great opportunities in Europe for the development of generic medicines .
Mr President , the Sec@@ chi report on the single market shows us how far we have come , but also how far we have got to go in achieving a truly efficient single market working for Europe &apos;s citizens .
With the absence of Europol , un@@ sav@@ our@@ y citizens of the EU , like big @-@ time criminals , child porno@@ graph@@ ers , pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ les and drug bar@@ ons , seem to have the liberty to cruise as pir@@ ates and bu@@ cc@@ ane@@ ers throughout the single European market .
The Commission has supported Turkish NGOs and professional organizations promoting human rights for a number of years , including the Human Rights Association , the Human Rights Foundation and the Turkish Medical Association .
In relation to the genetically modified so@@ ya that is coming into the European Union , could the Commissioner clarify that genetic modification in relation to this so@@ ya is a technique used in its production but that , in fact , no genetically modified organ@@ ism is actually present in the final product , which does not differ in composition from ordinary so@@ ya - from non @-@ modified so@@ ya ?
They must be followed by practical action , rather than mere declarations of intent .
The areas of responsibility of regional and local authorities must be taken into consideration , and they must become essential partners in the development of an effective Community policy , a factor of vital importance .
Thank you , Commissioner .
According to the final declaration , that future will come through more intense political dialogue and the development of economic cooperation .
For that reason the Commission should now determine how to transfer the GATT quantities that have not been fully utili@@ zed to coming years since it is already apparent now that additional quantities will become necessary in future .
Mr President , we must now forget that &apos; time he@@ als all wo@@ unds &apos; .
With a view to ratification , the Community and the three Baltic Republi@@ cs have already decided to hold a whole series of meetings in 1996 followed by annual consultations based on new agreements , so that the system establishing the 1997 fishing opportunities con@@ forms to the agreements signed on behalf of the enlarged Community .
But what concerns me most , and something that may be related to the earlier debate on the Mediterranean , is that through the International Baltic Sea Commission we have a form of self @-@ management of the countries around this common fishing area .
Consequently I just take this further opportunity to make it clear that a change of the kind that is required in the report , regardless of the merit of the arguments put , can only be made by the alter@@ ation of primary law and not by the introduction of a new regulation .
It needs to be said , however , that monetary stability cannot by itself solve all of the economic problems that the Union is facing today and will be called on to face in the future , and nor can it by itself put the European economy on an en@@ during competitive footing vis @-@ à @-@ vis the Union &apos;s major trading partners .
Ecofin Ministers had a thorough and fruitful exchange of views at their meeting on 11 November and will be considering the matter again next Monday here in Brussels .
The European Council in Madrid recognized the need for legal security to form part of the introduction of the single currency .
But if the European Union and the European Parliament want to appear credible and not to drive frustr@@ ated citizens , living in fear for their jobs , into the arms of gli@@ b populi@@ sts , the beneficial effects of the introduction of the euro must be felt not only by industry but also , and especially , by the workers of social Europe .
The Commission has also decided to organize , before next summer , a round table specifically devoted to the practical aspects of the transition to the euro , especially those of interest to trade and the consumer , and of course this House will be involved in that .
It should be clearly stated what the securities issued by governments are .
Taking specific advantage , I may say , of the approach adopted by the Commission itself , which , very early this year , launched a strategy document to provide food for thought for the various Member States , well , Parliament decided to join in and produce its own strategic discussion paper . That is the purpose of this own@@ initiative report .
The internal market is still a long way from being implemented in this field .
Among all those who argue thus , the European Parliament has hitherto consistently called for an independent , active employment policy as an integral part of a policy mix which takes employment seriously as an independent objective of action in the field of economic policy .
I am here because , today , you are due to adopt three reports on matters in which I take a very great interest .
The stability pact which we are being asked to approve , in the form of two Council proposals for Regulations , would serve to guarantee that the budgetary convergence of the euro States will be sustainable even after the single currency has come into force .
The first is that this is necessarily an interim report , because a great deal of information is required to complete the picture and it will take a very long time for the Commission to prepare that information .
When we talk about the percentage of drug addic@@ ts in the population , there are countless social factors involved , not just the question of how easy it is to obtain soft drugs .
We have been arguing for the rapid computer@@ ization of customs services and Article 8 , for example , now includes the objective of computer@@ izing the Community transit procedure by 1998 .
The whole - that is the European parties - must be greater than the sum of the parts .
We have to make an effort to implement and complete the 1997 legislative programme ; we need to fight unemployment through a range of effective policies able to promote the competitiveness of industry in the Union , regional , transport and environmental policy , a real effort to complete the internal market and identify an investment policy apt to stimulate economic activity ; we need to fight fraud ; the Commission must put a stop to shortcomings or abuses on the part of a Member State by sus@@ pending payments , recover@@ ing sums illegally obtained and imposing the requi@@ site penalties .
Partic@@ ular attention needs to be given to the 18 million - or in actual fact 30 million - who are out of work .
We assume that the Customs 2000 programme concerns agreement at Community level on criteria for the minimum extent of controls to be introduced .
I would just briefly disagree with Mr Sam@@ land when this morning he critici@@ zed the Council for being at the end of the line of ministers . Of course all too frequently they are at the end of a line of civil servants with politicians taking their dikt@@ ats from national civil servants who have no political background , are not respon@@ sive to democratic impul@@ ses but are largely officials serving finance ministers &apos; dikt@@ ats to cut spending , to increase re@@ funds to Member States and to bow the kne@@ e to Maastricht convergence criteria .
In the light of this aim , the European Union has devised a comprehensive pre @-@ accession strategy .
In addition , a positive decision that the Community interest calls for an intervention should be made .
The European Union &apos;s collaboration with non @-@ governmental development organizations has , for many years , been a cornerstone of Europe &apos;s international cooperation policy .
The costs not covered must be spread among all operators of telecommunications services .
That the Council is unable to demonstrate any serious degree of consensus on this issue nine months after the opening of the IGC is a cause of great concern .
If we regard these as key areas in relation to achieving greater democracy , transparency and ability to act and in preparation for enlargement , then I think this combination may really have given us a chance to make progress in this area at the IGC .
The Commission regularly discus@@ ses human rights on the international and world @-@ wide scene .
I should like in particular to thank the budget secretariat .
I really do not think that we should vote on this report today .
Thank you once again to the interpreters .
On Turkey , as Members are aware , the Commission &apos;s report of 9 October , on the progress of relations with Turkey since the entry into force of the Customs Union , already highlighted the deterioration in the human rights situation in Turkey throughout 1996 .
We are entitled to more than an attempt at a three @-@ card trick .
Surely respect for the rights of an elected assembly is central to democracy ?
There is no reason to go back over it .
Of course I can see the great benefits of the proposed system but strongly doubt whether these benefits out@@ weigh the huge costs involved .
Support for beef and ve@@ al sector
Madam President , this European Community that we belong to is a little more complex than it might seem to be at first sight .
A wonderful time , in which I always had the feeling that our work is meaningful , quite apart from leading to friend@@ ships between many people , from many nations and parties , who are united by their understanding of the meaning and task of Europe in the years to come .
Only a week ago I , as the representative of the Socialist Group , Mr St@@ asi of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party and Mrs André @-@ Lé@@ on@@ ard of the Liberal Group , returned from the first multi @-@ party legislative elections in Chad .
I do not have time to say more , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , but I wish to say that our criticisms are made in good faith , and that we hope that your excellent work bears fruit in the future at the Intergovernmental Conference .
The Stability Pact for the EMU , bro@@ k@@ ered in Dublin , is not something to be jo@@ y@@ ful about , although fur@@ thering the battle against unemployment was a stated objective of the Irish presidency .
Progress was made on the new European monetary system , the legal status of the Euro , and the Stability and Growth Pact .
We should like to think that this will be the basis of the negotiating approach under the Dutch presidency , in terms of content and method .
We need to maintain the progress we have made in other areas .
On closer inspection , I cannot help feeling that for the few genuine differences that exist , there are also many hypo@@ the@@ tical ones .
Countries which wish to have more extensive cooperation in fields such as foreign policy and justice can reach agreements on such matters outside the Treaty .
There can be no compromises in that respect .
Cross @-@ border credit transfers
No longer will banks include conversion charges in their total fees .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
In a truly mature relationship with Latin America these topics too must be discussed .
What we do not have , however , is an institution@@ alized parliamentary dialogue , and that is what the EP would like to see .
I am delighted to see that not only the Commissioner , the Latin America expert , is here but also the new vic@@ ep@@ resident of Parliament who is a member of my Group .
We can even give examples of the fact that we have come a long way in Scandin@@ avia and that free competition has given opportunities for an improved service and for the promotion of regional equality : the cost of national and international calls has been reduced considerably and there have been very significant developments going on .
From a socio @-@ economic viewpoint , I would warn against support which does not help to bring about structural change , since otherwise we shall have the same thing as in the agricultural sector , where we often provide social assistance rather than real agricultural support .
Austria has 3.@@ 87 million hectares of woo@@ ded area of which 86 % is managed .
Here , as has already been emphasized , we must monitor the progress of human rights , particularly in Azerbaijan .
Such a point of view seems to be shared by our Parliament , and in particular by you , Madam Rap@@ porteur .
Mr President , I have another question for the Commissioner .
I believe that what is needed , above all else , is a clear out of certain &apos; physical cultures &apos; that prevail not only in individual Member States and at local level but also in some major sections of the Commission itself .
In this context , the regional economic and social partners must be involved more closely in the activities of the supporting committees .
On the basis of this recommendation from the Committee of In@@ quiry , the Commission and Parliament can become natural allies once again .
Thirdly , a number of Members are sei@@ zing on the BSE crisis in an attempt to dis@@ credit the Europe of the Maastricht Treaty .
You said for example that there will also be re@@ dep@@ loy@@ ments in positions of responsibility within the Directorate @-@ General for Agriculture , involving individuals who have held responsibilities in the past and who are still working .
The general direc@@ torate for agriculture is certainly in need of a good air@@ ing .
That was the best non @-@ answer I have ever received from the Commission .
It seems indeed that the Swedish part of the line is going to be totally financed by the national railway infrastructure authority , the Ban@@ verk@@ et .
In any event , the absence of this explicit reference up to now has not prevented the Catal@@ onian universities from taking a very active part in the various schemes under the Socrates programme . For example , they have sent 3000 students on plac@@ ements abroad , and have received the same number of students from universities in other Member States .
This means that although we have not achieved the capacity that we and the industry judged to be appropriate , the removal of the over@@ capacity has had a positive effect on the remaining operators in the industry .
They know what they want , and they have established relationships with the Commission .
It is never too late to do good .
It must also be put on the record that from the moment of the first suspected case of BSE in my country we implemented a full @-@ herd slaughter programme .
On the amendments let me say the following : I can accept Amendments 2 , 5 and 6 . I regret , however , that the Commission feels unable to accept the other amendments today , and I should like to explain its reasoning to the House .
The conclusions of this report are crus@@ hing .
We think it is important that each individual in the EU has the right to reasonable basic levels of social security .
The Wei@@ ler report contains a number of sensible points covering actions to promote employment and sustainable economic development .
For the moment , opinions largely conflict , and we will have to cut short as matters have reached political level , but we wanted to know at least the ideas of the consumer associations .
In the interests of completeness I should say that this is a matter on which the European Commission has the right of initiative and that if the European Commission feels either that the labour market is no longer responding to the rules in force or that there are serious problems concerning this question of the principles of non @-@ discrimination , I think the European Commission will not hesitate to use its right of initiative .
Unfortunately no progress has been made and reports reaching us about the host@@ ages in recent months have been spar@@ se and contradictory .
I think the Commission must look at the way that organizations measure credit ratings and the ability of consumers to correct not only their own credit ratings , but perhaps those of members of the family .
In the long term , we need to arrive at the proposed solutions but , in the meantime , it would be useful if the Commission could develop some co@@ sting forecasts for the various levels of the universal service .
It would also be helpful if the Commission could in@@ sti@@ gate research on internal relations within the Member States concerning the free market and competition in this sector , respect of the regulations and any il@@ licit profit @-@ making or illegal use of sources .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must start by thanking both rapporteurs most sincerely for their efforts and congratulating them on the results .
Our transatlantic relations are entering a crucial stage at this time and we are facing many new challenges throughout the world .
The main value of this affair is the new light it casts on the real nature of the European institutions .
I therefore believe that , in pointing to the dangers of the presence of international criminal organizations , we should also point out that the Albanian Government needs to conduct a full and transparent investigation and , at the same time , launch a dialogue with all the opposition parties , for , without dialogue , it will be impossible to achieve the political stability that is so vital now .
This Iranian government is supposedly concerned to improve relations with Europe , but how does it actually imagine that such relations are to be established , and on what basis ?
Within the framework of the critical dialogue - and no , Mrs Roth , that dialogue has not broken down - the European Union is endeav@@ ouring to obtain further assurances from the Iranian Government regarding Mr Rus@@ h@@ die &apos;s safety .
I would therefore ask that this report be approved
To the report . What I think is particularly important is first of all that we opt for a compulsory system of registration and en@@ ro@@ l@@ ment with an insurance .
You fulfilled your obligation and fulfilled it very well , as all chair@@ men of Groups in this House agree .
It is good that they have been acknowledged by Parliament as we are often accused of sc@@ are@@ mon@@ gering when highlighting these facts .
We must say &apos; no &apos; , for the sake of human dignity , respect for the species and the principle of equality .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , modern biotechnology offers us great opportunities .
And advances in technology with new research techniques mean that the people employed in this sector are generally very highly qualified .
One Member , Mrs Est@@ ev@@ an Bol@@ ea , said that ship@@ building is more than ship@@ building .
I very much support what has been said about culture and creative work .
Parliament &apos;s decision on 19th February was clear , in that where health issues are concerned it wanted the co @-@ decision procedure .
If a genetically modified construction , or the act of obtaining it , presents a risk , that risk can mani@@ fest itself in different ways depending on the characteristics of the operation .
Mr President , the Commission &apos;s recruitment and staff policy is based on the principle of equality .
We aim to decide on this matter at the end of April together with our decision on the budget , so that the first stage of the reform can enter into force in January next year .
However it did slightly go off the mark , because the question related specifically to the opportunities for secon@@ d@@ chance education .
I thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his response and I appreciate the difficulty he has in being more specific .
Does the Council not think that participation by the Turkish Cypri@@ ots in these negotiations would mark a major turning point in relation to the Council &apos;s earlier decisions and run counter to the letter and the spirit of the decision of 6 March 1995 on the establishment of &apos; structured dialogue &apos; ?
I think that Mr d &apos;@@ Ab@@ o@@ ville said just now , for heaven &apos;s sake , that it was something like 12 % of the catch .
Dri@@ f@@ tn@@ ets have been banned for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen since the 1986 Treaty of Acc@@ ession .
The other track , even if this is apparently blocked at the moment for political reasons , is to act , for example , on the basis of the Italian government &apos;s proposals to work through structural measures aimed at the fishing communities in Italy to phase out the use of dri@@ ft nets by these communities and encourage them to switch to other techniques or other economic activities .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
If you multip@@ ly 18 million movements by ECU 25 , 000 you see that we have entrusted to this arch@@ a@@ ic , paper @-@ based transit system ECU 450 , 000@@ m of fiscal liability .
The third question is the transit system .
We are also aware of the fact that there are a number of important differences of detail which have to be resolved through the vote .
My point is that the way you have conducted business in this Chamber today was correct .
That , I believe , speaks for itself !
However , I also depl@@ ore the fact that the European Commission has not succeeded in providing for situations like this , and that the industrial policy pursued by the European Union has been incapable of dealing with the economic and social consequences of the necessary restructuring of certain large undertakings , especially those in the motor industry which have been so seriously hit by the crisis .
I believe that Europe therefore has every reason to attend to this aspect , in order to put an end to the ri@@ ots and help the country hold new elections .
We have reached a kind of moment of truth : we are either on the eve of substantial progress or on the eve of possible reg@@ ression .
Enhan@@ ced cooperation does not solve the problems .
Without pre@@ jud@@ ging the results , a year after the IGC began , recent events have shown on more than one occasion the limitations of the Union &apos;s present architecture with , for example , the failure of the Commission in the BSE tragedy and the inability of the Union to respond to the suff@@ er@@ ings of the Renault workforce at Vil@@ vo@@ or@@ de .
But I would like to honour those who before us thought of Europe , who acted in order to transform it and who entrusted us with the task of continuing it , and this means fair recognition of the fact that taking things slowly has always been the reason for its success .
Without openness , democracy , majority resolutions and constitutional control of the courts under the rule of law based on the constitu@@ tions of the Member States , no effective judicial area can be created at European level .
A result of this openness has been that no fewer than eleven parliamentary committees other than the Committee on Budgets have formulated amendments to these budget guidelines : 39 of the 13@@ 4 amendments tabled come from these committees , despite this not having been an easy task .
If no legal alternatives are available , it is easy for the ma@@ fia to step in .
This applies to both the political and the economic sectors .
They betra@@ y a patron@@ age , a did@@ ac@@ tic spirit , and an attitude like a rich un@@ cle who holds the pur@@ se strings and dict@@ ates what people are to do if they want to see any of it .
But what do we actually find ?
We must reiterate that the Serbian government is pursuing serious and unacceptable repression against the Albanian community of Kosovo and that Community is really experiencing major tension and pressure at the moment .
Women are suffering the violence of fundament@@ alist interpretation of their own religion . Women are ris@@ king their lives in the ongoing struggle by demonstrating publicly against violation of their rights , which are fundamental human rights , as the Peking statement confirmed .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to make a statement of principle : the Group of the European People &apos;s Party is in favour of discussing human rights , it is in favour of any violation of human rights being pointed out and punished , and in favour of preventive measures being taken wherever possible to stop such things occurring .
As already illustrated by my opening comments , things are still moving in the wrong direction in a number of areas .
In addition , as predicted , negotiations regarding a protocol on the Climate Change Convention , establishing binding objectives in the form of a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases , are proving , pre@@ dict@@ ably , to be very difficult .
I have hopes of Parliament supporting the proposal unanimously and that the Council on the 24 of March will decide to re@@ vo@@ ke the gener@@ alised tariff preferences .
Madam President .
I should remind the House that , on the occasion of the debate on the 1996 / 97 price package , I and a number of other Members tabled certain amendments on g@@ rub@@ bing @-@ up .
We must turn our backs on global free trade , on un@@ bri@@ d@@ led , stat@@ eless liberalism , which will eventually reduce our populations to star@@ vation .
Mr. President , this point concerns the same issue raised just now by Mrs Lind@@ hol@@ m .
I say again , the Commission regre@@ ts this situation , because the Commission attaches great importance to respect for the life and wellbeing of animals .
Food security consists in making sure that the new , genetically modified products are not harmful to our health and that of our desc@@ end@@ ants , in other words , that of the human race .
I live in a region which goes by the name of Ast@@ uri@@ as which has come into the international li@@ me@@ light recently with the signing there of an agreement on human rights and bio @-@ medicine .
If our industry and agriculture are to thri@@ ve , they must be fully supported by clear and comprehensive consumer protection rules , otherwise they will have to face unfair competition , mainly from the United States .
Mrs Bre@@ yer talks about a full @-@ scale attack on our health .
In speaking of the human rights situation in the EU , therefore , we must adopt a holistic approach , and not say like the Phar@@ is@@ ee in Lu@@ ke 18 , 11 : &apos; God , I thank thee that I am not as other men are &apos; .
( Parliament approved the ad@@ journ@@ ment of the vote on the second reading on the common position adopted by the Council until noon on Wednesday )
I think the Commission &apos;s proposal is a really ou@@ trage@@ ous one , especially when it has not had the courage to bring forward a directive at the same time on a minimum wage .
We can compare means , but it is not always easy , and perhaps not desirable either , to compare ends .
I would therefore ask you to be patient , because the evaluation and detailed research into the exact figures are already in hand , and I hope that you will be able to get a clearer picture from the reports which the Commission is currently drawing up on all ten of the applicant countries .
But remember , working with eleven languages has its obligations .
But every time we deal with issues like this , we come up against the fact that differences in national bankruptcy legislation mean problems for businesses at international level .
Finally , I should like to draw the Commissioner &apos;s attention to the fact that I am very disappointed with the new projects which the Commission hopes to follow under this SL@@ IM project .
This is not a report that can be approved without a high degree of consensus across the political groups .
These ref@@ us@@ als focused on breaches of the budgetary regulations and of the rules for awar@@ ding contracts .
That is what I wanted to say on behalf of the Commission , and I thank Mr Ala@@ van@@ os once again for his report and the European Parliament in general for the welcome it has given this agreement , which is the result of very difficult and complicated negotiations .
Having regard to this , the committee recommended a limited transitional period for southern states , because we have to be realistic , as well as ambitious , in setting targets .
My report , now at the codecision stage , on the inspection of motor vehicles and their tra@@ ilers also took that approach .
Madam President , I should first of all like to congratulate the Commission on drawing up this much needed proposal for a directive to stamp out long standing in@@ jus@@ tices which everyone was aware of but which could not be proved .
Madam President , we know that the Commission is in favour of Parliament deciding today , and the same no doubt applies to the Council .
We have 50 years of experience of a simple limit on the West Coast of Sweden and more recently in the Baltic Sea .
We think that this perspective is missing in relation to the requirement for lower fuel use in the report .
It is therefore high time , in 1997 , for a directive to be adopted , which finally obli@@ ges the employer and no longer the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff , to prove that the difference in salary between men and women does not arise from a difference of gender .
, Vice @-@ President of the Commission . ( ES ) Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the Committee on Legal Affairs and in particular the rapporteur , Mrs Fontaine , for the quality of her report and also for the interest she has always personally shown in the recognition of diplom@@ as , something which is of fundamental importance for the citizens of Europe who wish to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
Given the importance of the relationship of trust , it is prefer@@ able that the system progress by means of relations of trust between the Member States rather than the Commission having to systematically solve problems of interpretation of the directive by means of infringement procedures and resort to the Court of Justice .
Mr President , the Commission would like to congratulate Mrs Sch@@ mid@@ bauer on and thank for her excellent report on equality of opportunity for people with disabilities .
It is not large companies which are creating jobs , it is the eigh@@ teen million SMEs we have in the European Union , which are capable of doing so .
If the Council adop@@ ts the recommendations of the Commission , the number of countries which are no longer in a situation of excessive deficit will be brought to five .
Consequently I think that the message which emerges clearly from all of these predic@@ tions today is a message of encouragement , a message of recognition for the work and effort achieved .
The exchange of findings between small and medium @-@ sized undertakings is not always a matter of course , because afterwards they very often have to compete among themselves on the market .
The Commission and the Council apparently decided once more to go it alone as they had done most of the time before our committee enforced its initial , but short @-@ lived , involvement .
Chile has been able to overcome many of the difficulties of a political nature which every country must tackle in recover@@ ing liberty following a long and terrible dictatorship .
Mr President , in a few days &apos; time we will be celebrating the fif@@ tieth anniversary of the Chi@@ lean con@@ servatives , who are close to our European People &apos;s Party .
Imp@@ act assessment system for firms
I look forward to hearing colleagues contributions and to hearing Commissioner Pap@@ out@@ sis &apos; response to the House .
Whatever the reasons were , it ought to have been put right .
By this I mean that it is no use insi@@ sting on a three @-@ year conversion period before a farmer can sell his products as organic or use his crops as organic feed .
The Council &apos;s argument is that the declarations only serve to clarify the legal text , but why then are they so secret ? Why should they be with@@ held from the rest of us ?
As Mr Lannoye said , this is one of the most important criteria .
It is indeed possible .
Subject : White Paper on voluntary organizations and foundations
My reason for tabling the amendment is because , during the first debate on the Langen report , the Commission &apos;s text called for a ban on any technical dialogue between a contracting entity and anyone who wanted to bid for the contract at a later point .
As far as researchers are concerned , the opinion put forward by Mr Des@@ ama will encourage the Commission to submit to Parliament , at an early date , draft measures capable of eliminating the obstacles described in the Green Paper , and the Commission intends to take action on the opinion put forward by Mr Des@@ ama .
Mr President , I should first like to thank Hon@@ ourable Members , and especially the Commissioner , for having shown such detailed understanding of the fundamental aspects of this report .
( The sitting was closed at 10.@@ 28 p.m. )
The first is the concept of territorial integrity , a concept which is very important and certainly , in my view , the core of any common security policy .
However - and after all , this report was dealt with by the Committee on Foreign Affairs - we cannot talk about the arms industry and arms cooperation without outlin@@ ing the general context , which I see as follows .
The bad principle is that its particular nature has si@@ del@@ ined the European dimension and confined the activity to a national context .
Secondly , another very important point for a Parliament which shares budgetary power with the Council is to state that costs generated by common actions under the treaty must be included in the non @-@ compulsory section of the Community budget involving democratic control by Parliament and that specifically administrative expenditure should come under heading V and operational expenditure under heading IV .
We want to turn &apos; can make an appeal &apos; into &apos; insist that an appeal is made &apos; .
As somebody said , the statement from the Council representative was rather per@@ ple@@ xing , but hearing the position of the Commissioner , Mr Fischler , I am satisfied that he seems to have recognized the magnitude of the problem .
We are pro@@ found@@ ly convinced that if this humanitarian situation is not dealt with at the highest political level without delay and if the consultations taking place with all the countries interven@@ ing either directly or indirectly in the region do not achieve their goal , the humanitarian disaster which is already taking shape could turn into total catastrophe .
Apart from these principles , we lay down in the report a set of guidelines for a uniform procedure which must be gone through when we are negotiating fisheries agreements : the acquisition of the ful@@ lest possible information on stock levels ; consultation with the representatives of the local fishing industry ; a cost@@ - benefit analysis ; a mechanism to report back on the results of research ; and the education and training programmes which are funded as part of these agreements by the Community .
I can assure this House I am not a lobby@@ ist for anybody , and , as to merchan@@ ts of death , we do not meet many of them in Bol@@ ton market , so I am not sure what she means .
Lastly let me say this : we have two thousand tonnes of weapon @-@ grade pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um and uranium in the world , and that is bad .
Mr President , on a point of order .
The European Union must take immediate action to eliminate the virus of fundamentalism and prevent it from spreading .
I should like simply to recall the political determination and action by the French President on behalf of human rights , faithful to France &apos;s tradition .
I refer you particularly to the importance of the SA@@ VE programme .
However , in the north of the Union - in the Baltic and Bar@@ ents Sea regions - regional cooperation is also developing .
An evaluation of the results is necessary , so that tax revenue is not squ@@ ander@@ ed and wasted on irrelevant projects .
That will have to be based on the laying of a legal foundation , that is the inclusion in the Treaty of Union of an app@@ ended clause or statement recognising the special features and the need to tackle them by means of tailored policies and provisions .
I did not entirely understand the Commissioner , and I should like to know if he would be prepared to include Parliament &apos;s proposals in his draft for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community .
There have in fact been virtually no instances of a qualified @-@ majority decision , even with regard to internal market legislation , where any country has had to sacrifice its national interests , or lost a vote .
The user believes that a therapy helps .
With regard to the specific issue in point 5 of the motion for a resolution , concerning budget line B6 @-@ 7@@ 142 of the Bi@@ omed programme , I have to inform you that it was not legally possible to carry out the research projects referred to because non @-@ conventional medicines are not included in this specific programme &apos;s objectives .
The Convention on the establishment of the European Information System is also designed to improve the effectiveness of controls - this time on the Union &apos;s external borders - especially through the dissemination of information on persons or objects being sought .
The fight against crime within the Union is based on the dissemination of information between the national authorities .
Only in this way can we , as elected representatives of EU citizens , establish a closer link with them and put into practice our oft @-@ quoted desire to be &apos; close to the people &apos; .
However , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we shall continue to demand the setting up of this permanent structure , whether it is called a European ob@@ servatory or centre , since Europe absolutely needs an instrument that is efficient in terms of information , aler@@ ts and protection .
The debate is closed .
If we delay for too long all of the work being done in conjunction with the IMF and , to some degree , with the World Bank will be destroyed .
It is nonetheless important because , inevitably , the discussion on monetary union must be succeeded by an in @-@ depth discussion on fiscal union , which must follow .
Paragraph 15 of the report submitted to the committee , i.e. the one adopted on 22 May and the subject of the written report , contained the word &apos; new &apos; .
The Danish Social Democrats favour a certain coordination of policy on taxes and duties at EU level but wish to retain powers at national level to decide on VAT questions of key importance .
If a matter is not discussed , then there can be no further progress .
Amendment No 8 on aspects of the committee procedure must be rejected because a recital should be used to give the reason for the corresponding provision in a piece of legislation , and in this case there is no corresponding article in the regulation .
Mr President , we have called for tourism to be included in the Treaty .
Whenever we mention tourism to the Council , or indeed to the Member States , it seems to be that they collectively all go on holiday .
After detailed discussion of this matter with the Spanish authorities , the Commission is now able to approve the accumulation of aid that is being asked for , provided that effective and reliable project management is guaranteed , so that it is possible to make a clear distinction between the types of aid accord@@ ed for the project in question .
Where we think it necessary , however , some regulations will be adapted to reflect changes in the economic environment .
This is a decrease - announced in the budget - which is very important to the credit needs of the sheep and go@@ at meat sector , essentially due to market prices being higher than the budget forecast .
If the soci@@ alists vote differently , you need us to secure a majority on this point .
So there is a tradition of dur@@ um wheat production in Austria , that can be tra@@ ced back to the early 1960s and proved by plan@@ ting entit@@ lement certificates .
As almost everyone now knows , the novel foods regulation has failed .
It no longer refers to freedom of movement but only to free movement of individuals , and that in turn is further differentiated into free movement of individuals for Union citizens and for third country nationals - in other words , people who are living among us permanently but do not have natu@@ rali@@ zed status .
But we are offered no prospect of transparency in public life .
This was so in Bosnia and more recently in Albania . What happened there has led to dis@@ satisfaction of public opinion despite some truly positive efforts , such as those of our special en@@ voy to the Middle East , Mr Mor@@ at@@ inos .
Is that serious ?
But , above all , I have tried to indicate in my report that there is a great deficit in China : the so @-@ called internal market does not function - indeed never has .
For obvious reasons , so that farmers can decide how to prepare their soil for so@@ wing , they must know by 30 June each year the set @-@ aside rate for the following year . They have to organize their soil plans and order the various products - seed , fertili@@ zers , pesticides , etc .
The European Parliament , albeit elected by universal suff@@ rage , never enjoys any powers other than those deleg@@ ated to it by the different nations and their parliaments .
In this case sub@@ ver@@ sive propaganda means communicating information from within the country about the dread@@ ful conditions that prevail there .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are some lessons to be learned from the dramatic situation in Congo at this moment .
V@@ OT@@ ES ( continuation )
It is an@@ ec@@ dot@@ al that the European Parliament , at the proposal of the rapporteur , Mrs Fontaine , has not hesit@@ ated to deal with this apparently marginal question and to try and have several of its hob@@ by horses adopted .
Sport is a celebration of what we have in common , not of our differences .
It is true that the European Union is still using double standards here , and is not being quite consistent .
Generally speaking , however , it is true that countries which take respect for human rights seriously also tend to respect the right to development in the broader sense .
The Italian papers have certainly emphasized the points you made about Italy from the statements you made yesterday .
I therefore suggest that we keep it on the agenda .
I think it would need a mi@@ racle by the Ar@@ chan@@ gel Gabri@@ el to persuade Mr C@@ assi@@ dy to come round to our position .
Only if we can develop our own standards will we be able to con@@ quer the markets of the future .
No @-@ one knew anything about bananas .
Parliament was putting on the emergency brake when it set upper and lower percentage criteria for the proportion of combined transport - road and rail - in its decisions on the trans @-@ European Networks .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 00@@ 32 / 97 ) by Mr Ch@@ esa , on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations , on the proposal for a Council Decision ( COM ( 95 ) 49 @-@ 11@@ 15@@ 6 / 95 - C4 @-@ 06@@ 85 / 96 @-@ 95 / 00@@ 63 ( AC@@ C ) on the conclusion by the European Union , the European Co@@ al and Steel Committee and the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community , of the one part , and the Ky@@ r@@ gy@@ z Republic , of the other part , on trade and trade @-@ related matters .
Since the main points of principle have already been made , let me perhaps make a few comments on our recent experience with PHARE .
More than six weeks have now el@@ ap@@ sed , almost seven , in fact , so we are well past the deadline .
We wasted a great deal of time .
We should like to see this principle of &apos; equality &apos; set in stone , as the Amsterdam summit set it in the Treaty .
They appreciate that they have to come up with high quality projects in order to be considered .
The wording is new , the content old .
The danger of further legal fragmentation must be confronted .
An example of the problems raised is the case of the breast cancer gene already referred to .
This is exactly the kind of question that ought to be put to such an ethical committee .
But we want to state our own fundamental attitude to fishery agreements of this type .
There is expected to be a boom in services based on these numbers over the next few years , and I have stressed that the development of European numbers also needs to take account of the development of global numbers .
First there is the independence of the national regulatory authorities .
In all other respects we favour the amendment proposals tabled by the Liberal Group .
Last year when , for the very first time , we reviewed estimates by the Commission , this was only true in a very minor way .
As regards the draft supplementary and amending budget No 1 for 1997 , may I be permitted , while sal@@ uting the excellent job done by the rapporteur , Mr Lau@@ r@@ ens Br@@ ink@@ hor@@ st , who has succeeded in putting the emphasis on such priorities as creating new posts at the Commission , to express my Group &apos;s concern over the grant to the Tra@@ demark Office in Alicante , the entire allocation of 12.@@ 5 million ECU of which has been put into reserve .
Those documents confirm that development assistance has a prominent role to play in peace building and conflict prevention .
Indeed , the Commission has already done a great deal of work in an effort to resolve this problem .
Any black@@ list of carriers bears an inherent risk of re@@ tali@@ atory measures .
After serious consideration we have decided to vote against the directive while certain proposals of fundamental importance do not have the support of the majority .
Thank you very much , Mr Wohl@@ fahrt .
Mr. President , I think everyone who had the opportunity to be present as observers during the Albanian elections will have as@@ certain@@ ed - if they judge objec@@ tively - firstly that apart from a few minor episodes , a few weaknesses that were evident , the Albanian people demonstrated both responsibility and le@@ vel@@ he@@ ade@@ dness towards the conditions that have arisen in that country .
I have to say to the President @-@ in @-@ Office that Europe proved ineffective here .
Subject : Comp@@ ens@@ ation arising from the proposed abolition of duty @-@ free in 1999
Perhaps they thought it was just another letter about the European Parliament &apos;s procedures .
We shall emerge from this whole process much more careful and very much more critical .
After all , the roots of the agricultural policy lie in supplying food to the European Union ; the tobacco sector definitely does not fall within this objective .
The organizations involved must also be mutually acceptable to one another , particularly in cases where , over and above the level of mere hearings , it is a question of negotiations and results that are binding on third parties , where a constructive climate has to take precedence over all the different interests involved .
However , I should also say that some of those same opposite numbers dispute the influence their opinions can have on the decisions made by the Community institutions .
Now , the reference to the criterion of repres@@ enti@@ vity at European Union level , as the rapporteur , Mr Peter , has rec@@ alled , makes it possible de facto to exclude certain organizations , to exclude them from the negotiations and consultations provided for by the social protocol and to exclude them from the advisory bodies , because they are not members of European structures , as is the case with certain trade unions in France .
Le@@ aving the relations between the Commission and Parliament to one side , it is also an intellectual pleasure to be able to deal with one another in this way and to discuss what are indeed rather complex but very important matters for a large area of our economic life .
The Committee on Budgets , in its written opinion that appears in the report , proposed two amendments . One proposed that , in accordance with standard practice , the financial provisions should be incorporated into legislative acts ; the other stressed the exceptional nature of the combination of the &apos; loans / borrowing &apos; aspect and the &apos; grants &apos; aspect .
There was found little support from the Commission for this at first reading .
The guidelines which have emerged so far must become binding elements and concrete instruments of a genuine equal opportunities policy for the European Union .
Mr President , the Commissioner has deser@@ v@@ edly received a number of eu@@ logi@@ es today , eu@@ logi@@ es which must also be extended to the two rapporteurs , and I add my own .
That is why I sincerely hope you are now listening very carefully , and will support my proposed amendment .
By adopting this text , we will be em@@ powered to defend the interests of the public service , while also giving it the resources to adapt , and open it up to market conditions .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
They feel they have nowhere to turn , that they have been heavily pen@@ alized and ham@@ mer@@ ed by a large country and squee@@ zed out by multinationals .
Therefore , since we all want Chernobyl to be shut down , the Ukrainian Parliament has said that if the Kh@@ mel@@ nit@@ sky 2 group and Ro@@ v@@ no 4 are not completed - and soon , I should imagine - they will start up another of the in@@ active Chernobyl units . Do the Ukra@@ ini@@ ans want to take risks ?
As such , I think it is quite excellent and I would just like to urge you , if the new treaty is very close to coming into force , not to hur@@ ry some things through on the basis of the old standards if new information is needed .
Parliament &apos;s recommendations and suggestions will be taken into account by the Commission in the implementation of its action plan and in the preparation of the Luxembourg summit on employment .
The Americans also have their task to do what is needed to satisfy us in the negotiation .
We maintain that the west also has a responsibility for letting violence take hold .
But , opposing the fundament@@ alist violence of Islam , there is also the fundament@@ alist violence of Ju@@ da@@ ism .
But let us also remind everybody that life goes on in the Middle East .
The Israeli Government should end its policy of pro@@ vocation by means of the settlements , while the Palestinian Legislative Council should step up its fight against terrorism by arre@@ sting the activists , controlling and restoring order , and taking repressive measures against these terrorist groups .
I think it has set an unfortunate climate for the second reading and any possible further conci@@ li@@ ations .
I noted no analysis on the effect of the steps , inspired by American protectionist measures , which the Commission has taken in terms of import quotas for Japanese vehicles , and I noted no recommendation for the future .
As President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council I take note of the constant interest of the honourable Member regarding the situation in Sri Lanka , especially with regard to the respect , or rather lack of respect , for human rights .
Mr President . If Mrs Palacio Vall@@ eler@@ s@@ undi &apos;s happiness depends on this , then we agree , to make her happy today .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the political ultim@@ atum of the Ukrainian Government - and this is what it seems to be about - not to shut down Chernobyl if international funding for R@@ 4 and K@@ 2 is not forthcoming , must not be allowed to succeed .
This must be made clear in the bilateral contacts between the Union and Bahrain . Demo@@ crati@@ zation is the only solution that can end the situation there .
This was a hope which has now unfortunately come to nothing .
That is not contained in the Articles at all , only in the Annex .
Mr President , we are currently in a transitional period until monetary union comes into effect , allowing us to become more competitive , and our economies to conver@@ ge .
The effects of the reduced fishing opportunities for the EU fleet are well known ; we had years of stal@@ em@@ ate and deterior@@ ating relations .
There is an enormous discrepan@@ cy here , and would be very pleased if this issue could be treated as a priority , rather than just taking small steps here and there .
We in turn , if visas are granted , should be prepared to report fairly and honest@@ ly all that we see and hear several years on now from the dread@@ ful deaths of Del@@ i .
And we still allow this to happen today !
Furthermore , an agreement with Cambodia , but also with Vietnam and Laos , is above all a gesture of friendship by the EU as support for reforms in these countries .
What is needed is greater cooperation between the European Union and the other competi@@ tor nations , such as the United States , Russia , the Ukraine , Japan and China .
We have in some respects brought industry closer together , we work with it and there is quite a good ongoing debate . But there is still too little action from industrial quarters .
The repair clause does not depri@@ ve the car industry of its market share of the spare parts trade but merely opens it up to competition .
I would like clarification from you on this point .
To my mind it is certainly not a question of getting wra@@ pped up in a do@@ gmati@@ c vision by implementing a statutory 35 @-@ hour week in an authoritarian manner , but the reduction of the working week is something which the tide of history has brought with it .
H@@ ope has been held out to the unemployed on this , of course ; but I suppose the question is whether it is at all realistic to expect results , presum@@ ably also because certain members of the EU Commission have begun to refer to the summit meeting as a kind of study group .
I would therefore like to direct my attention to measures seeking to combat youth unemployment . I urgently request that we pursue our efforts with renewed vig@@ our , both at national as well as at European level .
I wish to express my heart@@ felt thanks to him and to the Committee on Budgets , which has been extremely cooperative .
Could the Commission clarify the Community legislation and indicate what provisions apply to Natura 2000 areas if they lie wholly or partially within military zones ?
The first thing I would like to say , and I am very glad that Mr Van den Broek is here today , is that Rule 90 has not been observed , that is , that the Commission would make an announcement when it received an instruction from the Council to work out an agreement , as prescribed by Rule 90 .
I hope that 21 November will become a great European meeting .
It is essential to harmon@@ ize the existing regulations because they differ in a number of ways and the differences have terrible consequences for the refugees .
I am in fact curious to know how the Member States themselves will handle it .
Here again it is infring@@ ing its own treaties .
Do they have something to hide ?
In any event we still consider it important and we have therefore tabled an amendment which again offers that choice , because that is the best choice .
Yet chocolate is just a minor addition to the nutrition of Man@@ kind .
The rules in eight countries have guaranteed women in the poorest countries such as Bur@@ k@@ ina Fas@@ o and Mali exports of she@@ a nuts which account for 20 % of their national product .
The Council will , of course , do this at the appropriate time on the basis of formal proposals of the Commission , bearing in mind that the legitimate interests of the European producers and producers from the ACP , and while respecting the existing international rules .
Unfortunately , I am a little afraid that this report is very difficult to read , in spite of the fact that it does not concern a legislative text , but an answer to a communication .
We have now reached agreement with the rapporteur that we shall try to arrange it again for the second reading . So as not to give the impression now that this is a programme which has to be defended by Parliament against the Commission , as though it had been rejected here , we have resolved to withdraw the amendment .
They are simply an ali@@ bi for those who adopt yet another gri@@ m austerity budget for working people , farmers and small and medium @-@ sized businesses , in the name of the competitiveness of large concerns and in support of the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant profits of big finance .
The under@@ signed Ö@@ VP Members have voted for the budget , because it is a good and important instrument for the further development of our common Union .
We must use all our influence to improve human rights in that country and of course the Taliban &apos;s unacceptable policy on human rights must be properly and consistently condemned .
That is something we can only condemn in the European Parliament .
And so it seems advisable to us for the Commission , and above all the Council , to coordinate this necessarily firm position with the United States , so that President Kab@@ ila does not have any way out and can be forced , by the international and European initiative , to observe at least some of the rules of democracy .
Only a short while ago U@@ PM @-@ Ky@@ m@@ men@@ e Finland and the Asian group AP@@ R@@ IL , operating from Singapore , agreed on the establishment of a joint company for the manufacture of paper .
She has pointed to cases of deliberate cru@@ el@@ ty and mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment of animals which have occurred in some Member States .
Amendments Nos 1 and 6 are a useful specification that checks must be carried out by expert officials of the Commission or the Member States .
I am very pleased to be having an exchange of views today on the outcome of the informal Foreign Ministers &apos; meeting which took place ten days ago in Mon@@ dorf .
The fact remains that after the W@@ ath@@ el@@ et period , Belgian justice was more corrupt , more in@@ efficient and more in@@ human than ever before .
Apart from some confusion about the terms child , youth , minor and junior , the steps proposed in the report are wholly to be welcomed .
This punishment in society will come about through reve@@ aling the acts of men who wish to be regarded as honourable in their own countries , in their families , and in their own surroundings .
It is discou@@ ra@@ ging that , after this long process , the Commission has accepted only 50 % , and the Council a mere 10 % , of Parliament &apos;s amendments .
To tell the truth , I am a bit worried that at second reading too , the Council will disregard the view of both Parliament and the Commission , is already unanim@@ im@@ ous and it will be a straightforward decision .
In order to make up the back@@ log , and we acknowledge that it is a huge problem , obsolete contracts and appropriations will be scra@@ pped .
I therefore really hope that we insist that there shall be no nick@@ el in the coins .
Just two further brief remarks .
The Luxembourg summit will be the acid test of our credibility , as an active employment policy and a reduction in the unemployment rate are also the best safeguards and guarantees of adequate social protection .
The collection of the premium forms the basis of social security in an economic and monetary union .
Social protection consists of a set of hard @-@ won social rights which progres@@ sively evol@@ ve .
Madam President , at the outset I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report which had the unanimous approval of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
What percentage reduction do we actually want to try to achieve ?
This imbalance is ru@@ in@@ ous for Turkey .
The events on which the income is based generally correspond to the principles of legality and adequ@@ acy .
As long as the destination principle applies , the goods on the way to the destination country are outside VAT and therefore subject to risk .
Their families deserve our solidarity .
Thus , the British Minister for Agriculture , Mr Cun@@ n@@ ingham , has appeared before your committee , and today , I am pleased to note the presence here of the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Fern@@ and Boden .
But what conclusion can we draw from the story ?
We must therefore have food legislation which is all @-@ emb@@ racing from a health point of view .
Ad@@ mittedly objective reasons must be given , but the room for manoeuvre is immense .
What we have before us is the result of labour market negotiations .
Mr President , as both a Dan@@ e and an Environmental Commissioner , I have been following the news of the serious environmental incident which happened in connection with the building of the Hall@@ and@@ s@@ å@@ s tunnel in Sweden very closely and with considerable interest .
If the project managers could not submit the required vou@@ chers within the set period , the conclusion of the projects which were then still open was based exclusively on the expenditure which was classified as claim@@ able .
It is important , in my opinion , that we pursue this through the Agenda 2000 package .
The draft regulation now before you clearly states that European resources should be used primarily for projects which are in accord with the Peace programme and that in this case priority should be given to projects which extend across the political and religious divide .
The proposal put forward has , it appears , come from two major groups who last week refused to accept a specific point on Iraq being put on the agenda .
But the important thing is that the seed , the possibility , exists .
All that happens is we are kept informed - and this in an area of policy that prov@@ okes very different reactions in all the Member States !
What is the outcome ?
Wher@@ ever you look , the Yugoslavia of Sarajevo , the Nigeria of the I@@ bo@@ s , the United States in 18@@ 60 and the Soviet Union , there is no exception to the rule .
It is therefore more important to be calm than to ag@@ oni@@ ze over it .
I would like to congratulate him .
The Commission has effectively taken a series of decisions in line with the recommendation of the Parliament .
We were agreed and the criticism was massive precisely because of the lack of openness and public insight as well as the &apos; concerns &apos; about supran@@ ation@@ ality , inter@@ govern@@ ment@@ alism and protocols etc. in the third pillar which make it completely incomprehensible , and mean that it could in fact lead to legal uncertainty .
However , when seen from the point of view of enlargement - and here , I am only repeating what our colleagues are also saying - this treaty is absolutely inadequate .
However , for all that , we are becoming more coherent in our external relations and increasingly acting as a single player on the international stage .
The Commissioner has shown that the USA and Europe are both partners and competitors at the same time .
If the United States continues with unilater@@ alism , we shall have been sold a p@@ up .
It is obvious that the existing rules on competition in the agricultural sector , or in the aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical , naval or audio @-@ visual industries , should be just as valid on the east or the west coast of the Atlantic .
As concerns the supplementary question , I have just said that the Commission &apos;s mission was to take the necessary measures and as necessary to present appropriate proposals to ensure compliance with rules for the protection of consumer health .
This is a highly effective instrument for promoting competition , as the consumer who wants to choose a different telephone company will no longer be discou@@ ra@@ ged by all manner of aw@@ k@@ ward number changes .
Mr President , The Committee on External Economic Relations requests that you reject the urgency application .
Schengen will be one more dimension that needs to be incorporated in the coming negotiations .
In particular , I endorse the proposal that Europol should be given precisely defined operational and executive powers determining which national police bodies are to be responsible for all the measures carried out in their countries .
And if so , what was the result of all these efforts ?
Madam President , the problem of the Ch@@ it@@ tag@@ ong Hill Tra@@ c@@ ts is not well known , however it concerns a large region which is relatively well populated ; this is a region which , we could say , has been somewhat abandoned by the world , and in which for long years , perhaps thirty or forty , in fact since the partition of India after the war , a problem has existed which has never been confronted with the desired strength and will .
Otherwise , perhaps we are for@@ fei@@ ting our Nordic customs union .
I do not believe that international exchanges can be reduced to globalization which has no respect for people , and I do not believe that univers@@ alism can be reduced to uni@@ formity .
The agreement that we shall be approving today is in line with these requirements .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in conclusion please allow me to emphasize once more the exceptional and complex character of the enlargement process we have comm@@ enced .
The system succe@@ eds in its most important task , namely to see to it that there are stable and sufficient means .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , Mr Commissioner , as an Austrian I am delighted to be the first speaker from my group - in fact , I come from a country which is considerably affected by the enlargement of the European Union , although I realise I am only speaking first because Klaus Hän@@ sch arrived relatively late due to difficult circumstances and he was generous enough to allow me to speak .
The best proof in our time is Hungary &apos;s freedom @-@ struggle in 1956 , which , if the cold war is regarded as the Third World War , might really be described as the Stal@@ ing@@ rad of the Third World War , for since that Battle of Budapest , relations with the Soviet Union have gone steadily down@@ hill .
These are things which show that Hungary has really belonged to Europe from the start and therefore has a right to be accepted as soon as possible , quite apart from the fact that the Hungarian economy has a thoroughly western style and has made great progress .
We must therefore focus our attention on attempting to implement this political decision correctly , that is , on the ways in which enlargement is to take place in the smooth@@ est and most effective way to ensure it achiev@@ es its objectives , which we have all outlined on various occasions .
I will conclude by saying that , above all , we should remember that this is a political process , not a technical one .
Therefore , our group will be supporting four amendments , namely Nos 2 , 26 , 27 and 28 . We consider they do not take anything away from the report .
Mr President , if the Union gets larger , what else grows ? Stability ?
First , on the single currency .
We are told that it is absolutely imperative to preserve the 1.@@ 27 % of GDP ceiling for Community contributions , in order not to compromise the efforts of the states to satisfy the convergence criteria .
I want to address a number of points in Mr Gas@@ ò@@ li@@ ba &apos;s excellent report .
But to stop in mid@@ stream would be counter@@ productive .
We have taken particular care to see that the five local authorities in Wall@@ onia also agree on a better system of cooperation .
Finally I would like to thank the Commission for a good Green Paper , and I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for a constructive collaboration , both within the Committee and hopefully also now that we are considering the matter in this part @-@ session .
We cannot ignore the fact that some countries process an ab@@ normally high volume of mail for cross @-@ border destinations , compared to their domestic mail .
We achieved a new nom@@ en@@ c@@ lat@@ ure in a certain area of agricultural spending .
We all recognize this but this is a constructive budget and I trust it will be the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner to even greater cooperation in the future .
However , there is a strong need for increased funding for these initiatives and I call for 1999 to be announced as the European Year against Viol@@ ence against Women for this will be a further encouragement to increase those budget lines .
What we want to emphasize , however , is that , because the future financial prospects are uncertain , we also need to review the overall financing in the light of the new financial prospects ; not only , but , in particular , when the new member countries join , the overall maximum amount will have to be reviewed , because we think this proposal is only adequate for the 15 member countries .
Comple@@ ment@@ arity between cohesion policy , on the one hand , and R &amp; D policy , on the other , seems hard to achieve as a solution .
You did not think where the raw materials for pharmaceutical and cosmetic products come from .
The steering committee says there is still no functioning certified herd scheme , not even in Northern Ireland .
Unless you have the figures you cannot determine policy .
This method is a direct consequence of un@@ controlled liberalization , because the traditional postal companies , in competition with private companies , cannot afford to take on these systematic over@@ heads .
We also talk , obviously , for it is the crus@@ hing argument , of the risks of surpluses which justify a re@@ working of the COM .
It does not therefore seem il@@ logical to me to ban all forms of advertising which encourage smoking , including of course , the sponsor@@ ing of cultural and sporting events , whilst taking care to maintain the employment generated by tobacco growing in Europe .
Until then the subsidi@@ zing and support of producers and their employment must continue unab@@ ated .
Integr@@ ating new criteria associated at the same time with the countryside , the environment and employment , seems to us a fundamental requirement of reform , which would be fairer to small producers .
I am sure that we can continue to rely on your support in this important task .
To for@@ go any of these options for ideological reasons would , in my opinion , be down@@ right stup@@ id .
We began in the 1980s with Latin America , followed by the ACP zone and the developing nations . Now we have the Ph@@ are and Tac@@ is programmes for central and eastern Europe and the Med@@ a programmes for the Mediterranean area .
According to the Commission , and also to the report which we shall decide upon today , bench@@ marking should not only be applied at the company and industry level , but also in relation to framework conditions for companies .
It is only because the costs of the actions are charged to the general Community budget that the job of administ@@ ering them lies with the Commission , as provided by article J@@ 11 of the Union Treaty .
Consumers must be informed about these threats and in this I share your viewpoint completely .
By fav@@ ouring more profitable services , opening up to competition risks sh@@ at@@ tering the coherence of national networks , and open access to freight free@@ ways for all operators - which is demanded in the report - moves in this direction .
I share his view that the space industry must &apos; bol@@ dly go along the path towards a concentration which will enable it to compete with American manufacturers . &apos;
In fact , the text we had adopted in committee reads as follows , at the end of Paragraph 2 : &quot; Parliament will then vote on the recommendations , with no amendments ; there will be a single collective vote for this proposal &apos; . The text submitted to us today is , &quot; Parliament will then vote en bloc on the recommendations , with no amendments &apos; .
Madam President , I found the last contribution rather surprising because anyone who has observed the process of economic and monetary union over the last 7 ½ years knows that this House has followed the whole process very closely .
Have the economic and social conditions for the introduction of a single currency been achieved in Europe , and in particular , have the following two sub @-@ conditions been met ? Are the European economies conver@@ ging sufficiently , and are the peoples involved sufficiently supportive of the project ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the prior question has not been dealt with .
Business will have to deal with the requests for information on this great monetary innovation in brief , clear , conc@@ ise terms .
However , the two Americ@@ as , North and also South , have for 500 years been linked , wil@@ ly @-@ n@@ il@@ ly , to the European nations by a community of civili@@ z@@ ations .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
The attitude of the British Presidency in supporting the right of this Parliament to give its view on the recommendations of Ecofin on which countries should be in the first wave of EMU has given a clear message of democratic commitment for which we are very grateful .
&apos; This assumes that by the year 2010 all the member countries will have the same ambitions for a unified Europe , and the means to achieve this .
Besides , if I have understood correctly , that is what the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council too implied in his speech .
The shock caused by the brutal closing down of the Renault factory in Vil@@ vo@@ or@@ de a year ago seems to have passed .
The Kurdish question is , as we all know , past history , yet unfortunately it should be recognized that a solution cannot be expected in the near future .
Given that the southern co@@ asts of the Union are no longer national boundaries but frontiers of the Union , we ask that common and lasting solutions be urgently found .
Subject : Freedom of movement between Sweden and Finland
While on the one hand the Union , together with the Member States , has to take measures to protect boundaries to make sure that there is a regulation of migration , it is equally important for the Union to uphold the principles which are incorporated into the Convention on Refu@@ ge@@ es and for the Member States also to uphold those principles .
Given that the Commission &apos;s approach is not in question and , lacking concrete suggestions for improvement , the Commission considers it particularly inappropriate for the signals put out to the operators to seem to depri@@ ve them of the possibility of having , in a short time , a fiscal framework capable of allowing them to benefit fully from the liberalization of telecommunications services , to the profit of our companies and all the consumers .
We have had the Europe of Schengen , which removed the internal borders of the European Union , and here we have the Europe of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which is removing its external borders .
Sierra González report ( A4 @-@ 03@@ 99 / 97 )
In order to combat unemployment , it is necessary in fact for workers to regain their confidence , in order to increase productivity , and the flexibility of work and wages .
We shall therefore vote for this text , but we would however like to emphasize an important aspect .
Many countries , including France , but not only France ...
The Commission shares most of the findings as expressed in draft resolution , and in particular the necessity to improve the coordination between the various agents in the field of humanitarian aid , including the Member States .
Simil@@ ar arrangements are included in the Protocol negotiated with Lithuania .
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
The second question I should like to raise relates to the policy of encouraging quality .
Madam President , it is very positive that Parliament is drawing attention to the special situation and the problems which the EU &apos;s mountain regions have .
This was a very important point .
The next item is report ( A4 @-@ 00@@ 12 / 98 ) by Mrs Pack , on behalf of the European Parliament &apos;s delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text , approved by the Conciliation Committee , for a European Parliament and Council Decision amending Decision No 8@@ 19 / 95 / EC establishing the Community action programme Socrates ( C4 @-@ 00@@ 02 / 98 @-@ 97 / 0@@ 103 ( COD ) ) .
The Minutes of yesterday &apos;s sitting have been distributed .
This is , however , no reason to vote against the report , which is itself un@@ conten@@ tious .
But in his report Mr White wants to return to the pre @-@ Edinburgh stage : he wants a directive , not a recommendation , and he wants a directive based on legal basis 100@@ A and 13@@ 0@@ S to boot .
Ear@@ lier messages about fewer but better rules have got no further than words .
The Danish Social Democrats are following the voting list of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the report by Mr Coll@@ ado on the technical feasibility of trans@@ European hydro@@ logical networks .
But in addition , we need to rid tourism of its negative image and poor reputation .
We are in the middle of re @-@ defining our role as the controlling body of European bureaucracy .
If there is to be any discussion of committees of inquiry , it must be in that area , looking at the system by which the Commission exam@@ ines allegations of in@@ adequ@@ acy , of impro@@ pri@@ ety , of irregul@@ arity against itself and its staff .
Is it understood that Europe &apos;s future central bank should be subordin@@ ate to public legislation ?
It has accurately and compet@@ ently provided objective , comparable information on the environmental situation in Europe , so that Parliament , the Commission and the Member States can all respond appropriately .
I have to correct her by telling her that the last time this proposal was dealt with by the Council of Ministers it did not vote it by unanimity , which was why when we rejected it in Parliament they could not re@@ inst@@ ate it .
The Commission put forward its first proposals in July 1991 , and as we remember and have been reminded during the course of the debate , the European Parliament rejected that proposal in May 1996 on the grounds that the level of environmental protection was not high enough and that there were too many exemptions .
I am particularly concerned about exemp@@ ting underground disposal .
Exist@@ ing land@@ fill sites must meet the new requirements of the Commission &apos;s proposals and so obtain new licences before they can continue to operate .
Mr President , I want to make it clear to the House that establishing the method for control and transparency is not a matter for the Conference of Presidents . We were invited to a meeting in Luxembourg so that we could give our opinion , but we did not stay in the room because we were invited to leave when Parliament &apos;s Bureau made the decision .
Ear@@ lier requirements on industry , such as in the introduction of cataly@@ tic conver@@ ters , clearly showed that if the requirements are clear , industry adap@@ ts to the reality and conver@@ ts its production to meet the requirements .
In Parliament we have always defended the view that economic development and the protection of the environment are not two opposing objectives , but are complementary .
It is up to the Irish people themselves to decide whether they want to vote in favour or against .
As they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
I thank Mr Wi@@ be for his question but he is not really introducing any new information .
Mr President , it is a pity that the rapporteur has sung his own pra@@ ises because otherwise I would have done so and coming from me that would have been even more exceptional .
I also support an intensive , constructive and fac@@ tual dialogue with the people about this new technology .
In addition , we know that fla@@ ws in this area include the fact that sometimes there is a lack of effective procedures to compensate consumers , that there is a lack of clarity about liability for theft , that the rules on the burden of proof are unclear , i.e. who must prove what , and that the position of customers in bankrupt@@ cies can be vague .
As the Union has reiter@@ ated many times , the Commission still deeply regre@@ ts the existence of the fat@@ wa against the British author , Sal@@ man Rus@@ h@@ die , which has already been in place for nine years .
The opportunities offered by the end of the cold war to get rid of large categories of weapons of mass destruction , are thus lost .
The damages represent more than 21 000 million pes@@ etas .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission shares in the suffering of the families of the victims in both Greece and in Malaga , and it regre@@ ts the physical damage caused .
From reading the contribution it is not clear that was the intention of his remarks .
But in doing so we send out signals .
Likewise , the Commission will change the procedure for cancell@@ ations which it has allowed .
You must be more careful now and look after it well , since you have seen that your card is obviously especially valuable .
Can you tell us what you think of this oral amendment ?
We think the message in the report is very positive .
My group , the Liberal group , is pres@@ ently focusing its attention on non@@ European Union nationals .
We can therefore support many of the amendments in the Ku@@ hn report .
This is explained in the minority opinion which suggests that on three of the agencies Parliament is not cla@@ wing back as much power as it should .
That is the problem : you cannot comment on things that you have not read .
This dist@@ ress , and this waste of human life and financial resources , are not acceptable in a civili@@ zed society with all but unlimited technical capabilities .
Firstly , Member States vary to a considerable degree in their practices and their views on the establishment of targets .
Secondly , so that , in the aw@@ ful event of an incident , the emergency services have to hand as much information as possible and can make effective use of their resources .
Article 113 offers the Commission no explicit authority to sign the MA@@ I on behalf of the Member States .
On important policy areas such as the environment , and in the social and cultural sphere , it could have a negative effect .
I am a bit reluctant to regard the lodging of a complaint as something that itself should be looked at in the context of Community interests .
This will allow much more detailed analysis than in the past and it will facilitate the essential monitoring , fine @-@ tuning and understanding of relationships between different policy outcomes .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports and oral questions :
It certainly gives me satisfaction that my promise to Parliament to present eight health programme proposals has now been fulfilled , and Parliament has been a very great help in delivering on the promise .
Mr President , the first thing I would like to assure this House is that European Liberals wish in every way to facilitate and speed up the enlargement process which is now being introduced , with the aim of a heal@@ ed and united Europe .
Unfortunately , the Commission and the Council have once again taken a different view of the arguments put forward by Parliament on the form of the accession partnerships and as a result have rated several important factors differently to the European Parliament .
In Croatia , as we know , President Tu@@ d@@ j@@ man &apos;s recent speech to his party congress , the situation in eastern S@@ lav@@ onia and the way in which the Day@@ ton Agreement is not being enforced effectively all indicate that the international community must not drop its guard in the region .
He was accompanied by the Commission .
Perhaps these can be discussed during the bilateral agreements between various countries .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , thank you for your answer .
I suggest that there should be more cooperation .
To this end the Council has also encouraged parliamentary exchanges .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking Mr Ca@@ be@@ z@@ ón Al@@ on@@ so who accepted practically all our amendments in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
I promise on my part that in future I personally will do what I can to help find a solution to the demographic problem .
For Ukraine to make a decisive step forward it has to offer a more inviting environment to foreign direct investment , and failure to get to gri@@ ps with economic reform is undermining that process , as we have seen from recent statements by the Americans .
There are still massive sec@@ es@@ sion@@ ist movements in the Cri@@ me@@ a .
It is also a result achieved in part by the people of Ukraine , a result which bears witness to their ability to impro@@ vise , but also , let me be bl@@ unt , to their ability to end@@ ure suffering .
One final remark seems necessary . Ukraine belongs to the Comm@@ on@@ wealth of Independent States , which celebrated its sixth anniversary last week in Minsk , the capital of Belarus , and I was honoured to be invited to participate .
It is aston@@ ishing that only 20 % of the electricity that is supplied in Ukraine is actually paid for in cash .
I freely admit that even I myself took part in the protests , with the result that I was not able to follow what was happening .
In fact , I think we are about to be hypo@@ critical as the measures proposed by the contact group and others could have been applied over the past few years - I have brought up this subject here on many occasions - to prevent out@@ breaks of violence .
I believe we failed in this . And we will most definitely fail if , a few months before the elections - for which we are laying down some conditions - we think that they can be held simply because we don@@ ate money to them .
But it is an en@@ viable position to have been in - the West African Fron@@ tier Force in Sierra Leone .
This is a question of elem@@ entary respect for European rules .
In political terms this is understandable .
Let us listen to the ACP countries when they point to our violations of human rights .
In its Agenda 2000 proposal , the Commission also highlights the importance of competition policy in the Associ@@ ated Countries throughout the pre @-@ accession stage .
It was a good discussion , and I look forward to working together more .
Madam President , could I ask you please to take up once again with Air France the problem of travel , particularly from the United Kingdom to Strasbourg .
The committee rejected by a narrow majority certain proposals for compromise as negotiated under the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship of the draftsman .
The entrepren@@ eur ultimately knows best what costs he and his business can sustain .
The single market , ladies and gentlemen , is in a bad way right on the eve of the euro .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs of all the reports , and in particular Mr Elles for his outs@@ po@@ ken and un@@ bi@@ ass@@ ed report .
With regard to Mr Tom@@ lin@@ son , I have to say that the problem has to be examined .
I must point out that with the correc@@ tive action proposed - it matters not how we go about it - a great lack of clarification is removed .
Once again , I wish to den@@ ounce these blo@@ ws against the values of solidarity and justice .
On the other hand , I think it is of course appropriate that those who commit fraud with EU subsidies are carefully investigated and caught at national level .
This very clear political signal from the European Parliament made a very substantial contribution to the success of the European Employment Summit last November in Luxembourg .
Why is it not possible to change the name ?
For the members of the Green group who see economic growth as something objec@@ tion@@ able and technical development as a threat , the only thing left is to cling to the idea that you can eradicate poverty through declarations , conferences , resolutions and conventions .
We are now standing at a cross@@ roads .
I completely agree .
Hence , at a time when those countries are in the thro@@ es of crisis , nobody is going to try and sell us a policy based on the South Korean model .
Firstly , we are wi@@ dening the single market here .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon .
Today , 50 % of the population are poor - it is true - but the other 50 % are experiencing a continu@@ al increase in their standard of living and there are already the beginn@@ ings of a middle class .
We must all be clear about that , and therefore we must think more about our security .
Nuclear waste and environmental pollution are a threat to the whole of Europe .
I want to draw your attention to this point as the obligation to publish complete and detailed minutes during such time as the members of the board are still in post may cause a problem in terms of independence .
I would say to Mr Ber@@ tens that some of those matters were discussed in theory when we were dealing with the Amsterdam Treaty .
I wish to congratulate the President @-@ in @-@ Office on his last answer .
Perhaps he ought to tell Mr Blair to stand up to Mr Mur@@ doch and the Sun and declare in favour of that .
I see the Council &apos;s answer as very positive and would just like to ask a supplementary question .
I would hope that Mr Wynn could reconsider this point .
In the fourth star@@ red point of paragraph 8 , again at least in the German version , there is such an unfortunate formulation that I do not understand it at all .
We have heard the question asked by the chairman in response to a request from several members of the Sub@@ committee on Human Rights , and the Committee on the Rules of Procedure was greatly embar@@ ras@@ sed . We either had to reas@@ sert the right - a right which had been violated - or , I would not say adapt to the reality , but recognize that , in fact , this situation might not be ideal .
The report also reflects the fact that national legislation has ce@@ ased to reflect human reality .
I think the implications of the Amsterdam agreement must be taken into account in this matter and we would have to vote against those particular points , though I hope we will not need to oppose the full report .
That is why the European Parliament should once again break through this sh@@ rou@@ d of silence , raise its voice in protest , and ensure that it is not just a question of flat@@ us voc@@ is , of a formali@@ ty within the framework of business as usual , of an appeal to the heart of the authorities of a state which , since 1982 - since the air bombar@@ d@@ ment of a district of Phil@@ adel@@ phi@@ a , the headquarters of the black movement Move - has been mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess to those who , like Mum@@ ia Abu @-@ Jam@@ al , have fought for the eman@@ cip@@ ation and equal rights of Af@@ ro @-@ Americans .
Mr President , I would like to say for the Minutes that we should take up the proposal made by Mr von Wogau and Mr Herman , that we all sympath@@ ize with Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath , and that no one in our group took part in the boy@@ cot@@ t of this proposal , which you did not read out , incidentally .
The European Parliament , which is the only directly elected institution at this level and which enjoys certain powers be@@ sto@@ wed upon it by the Treaty , will be ideal as the ECB &apos;s privileged political point of contact .
The enlargement we are considering is an enlargement into central Europe .
In the work on fighting em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of Union funds , I have seen for myself how delays in ex@@ changing information between different legal systems are a direct encouragement to crime .
The answer is short . The answer is &quot; No &apos; .
But the indirect support which is available today in the form of fla@@ gging out rules is much greater and could have much more serious consequences , namely the fla@@ gging out which would take place in ferry traffic if duty @-@ free were abolished .
You know , as I do , that the taxation of capital on this continent has gone down by 10 % in the last 15 years .
Firstly , the committee deleted Amendment No 4 concerning Article 4 , paragraph 1 ( b ) of the Council proposal .
The plan does not exist in a vacuum : as it has been prepared considerable progress has been made by the Ukrainian Regul@@ atory Authority , under Mr S@@ my@@ sh@@ ly@@ a@@ ye@@ v , the head of that authority , who will have the responsibility for the safety standards under which the work in the shelter will be carried out .
As a consequence , however , the agreed trade rules will in any case lead to efforts being made to arrive at a rational outcome in cases of dispute , and this should be warmly welcomed .
That is why there is no need for a special , outstanding effort to give approval to this Agreement here .
There is a women &apos;s centre in Ball@@ y@@ been .
This was important for our assessment .
For this reason , it is vital to install mechanisms whereby Union action can ease the burden on Member States in situations such as these .
Mr President , we are about to take an historic step in the true sense of the word , that clearly separates the &quot; before &apos; from the &quot; after &apos; .
Pur@@ su@@ ant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I have received a joint motion for a resolution from seven political groups on oral questions relating to competition in the textiles and clothing industry .
I feel that there must be more coherence by the Commission in how it approaches the needs of the textile industry .
In his report , the rapporteur raises the question of the role of the Court of Justice in the interpretation of the convention and finds that it is limited .
We even doubt the necessity for very restrictive regulation at Community level in this area .
I would also go further and say that it is a bad idea to impose it at Member State level .
Each government must incorporate the euro into its functions and must ensure that the new currency becomes part of daily life , and hence part of the national consciousness , as quickly as possible .
Mr President , I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this historic debate .
Today is a day which brings us down to earth , from the European dream to the citizens &apos; reality , and while we may congratulate ourselves on this enormous step , we must also call today for better definition and completion of other policies : social , environmental , political , fiscal , et@@ ce@@ tera , so that the single currency can truly be a factor of stability , growth and peace .
I welcome this un@@ reserv@@ edly .
Although the fixed exchange rates may be correct at the time EMU is born , and the currency stable , because of historical and structural differences in the various countries , the introduction of the euro could cause enormous problems .
Mr President , we will vote against both the common position and the Rothley report since it approaches this issue , which is of vital importance for the present and future of mankind alike , with techno@@ cratic and financial regulations . Nor does it provide for and establish rules and strict , pre @-@ emp@@ tive , repressive , continuous and effective controls to prevent the risk of causing an aff@@ ront to mankind and nature and the over@@ turning of social life and of human growth and development .
It should be noted that pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als are a world leader in the European Union and represent a considerable amount of wealth in this Union .
We must be perfectly clear that tobacco k@@ ills 5@@ 48 000 Europeans every year , more than road accidents , alcohol , mur@@ ders , drugs and suici@@ des put together .
European governments and the EU institutions must now focus their attention on promoting health education in schools in the area of making young people aware of the dangers of smoking .
Thus , it stands to reason to ban tobacco advertising in other media .
It is clear from the number of concerns which have been raised that the ethical dimension needs to be water@@ tight , otherwise we will face enormous difficulties in the future , difficulties which would benefit no @-@ one , least of all the people whom the patient groups represent .
By the same token , many opponents of the directive have exagger@@ ated the practical consequences of granting a patent and have made arguments that imply that any patented product is approved for use .
The figures I have seen relate to 1993 and they came to £ 2 billion in England and Wales for the replacement of water companies &apos; lead pipes and £ 6 billion for the replacement of domestic pipes .
As regards nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , it has to be said that , although an alarm threshold is a wonderful idea , a value of 800 micro@@ grams is really much too high , Madam Commissioner .
These changes will strengthen our means to protect taxpayers against fraud and che@@ ating .
At a time when society is reflecting upon the issue of transmission of our knowledge and values to future generations , it is particularly re@@ assuring to see the European institutions looking into the concept of knowledge .
It is important to emphasize the value of new technology and the Internet from the point of view of information .
Look at what my grand@@ children are seeing now . &apos; He was , of course , at that stage referring only to the television .
Having said that , and I made the point on Monday , our group last night discussed this fully and we feel that all six candidates are competent members of the European Central Bank and we will be voting for all six today .
By an@@ alog@@ y , I do not see why it should be any different for central bankers .
There is an anti @-@ fundament@@ alist reason : having given up smoking ten years ago , I do not understand the all @-@ emb@@ racing fur@@ y against smo@@ kers on the part of people who want to impose their moral values .
For all these reasons , I will vote for the European single market and against a restriction on the advertising of legal goods .
Mexico also in many cases contra@@ ven@@ es human rights with regard to its treatment of several national minorities that belong to its indigenous population .
Above all , do they have the will to provide themselves with democratic and legitimate political institutions capable of designing and implementing a common defence policy ?
And today our Belgian premier is giving his name to a report on a joint EU mini@@ stry of defence , joint weapons production and joint armed forces .
What is the objective ?
I find this just as de@@ pressing as the other day when I actually read the T@@ inde@@ mans report .
I also remember very well the reports made by Mr T@@ inde@@ mans in which he repeatedly argued in favour of activ@@ ating a clear common defence and security policy as the ultimate objective of a strong European Union .
I direct this remark to the Council .
Furthermore , we cannot overlook an obvious aspect , which Mr Sak@@ ell@@ ari@@ ou and the rest of the speakers have mentioned .
When we clarified this there were no further concerns .
Thank you , Commissioner Bangemann .
As far as the 112 number is concerned , the only country which has not yet implemented it is Greece .
We are going to support it .
I support the development of an EU defence policy . I consider that it is an indispensable part of European integration .
The fact that they have consistently proved to be without foundation unfortunately does not prevent their repeti@@ tion .
For example , I have reservations about recital F. A point one should make to our Slovak colleagues , if they are listening to us , as I am sure they will be , is that we are not sing@@ ling out Slovakia in particular for criticism .
Malaysia @-@ Indonesia -B4 @-@ 05@@ 14 / 98 by Mr Tel@@ kämp@@ er , Ms McKenna and Mrs van Di@@ jk , on behalf of the V Group , on human rights in Malaysia ; -B4 @-@ 05@@ 33 / 98 by Mr Ber@@ tens , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the un@@ rest in Indonesia ; -B4 @-@ 05@@ 45 / 98 , by Mr Titley and Mr Har@@ rison , on behalf of the PSE Group , on human rights in Malaysia ;
He said : &quot; If I were Italian today I would be fasc@@ ist &apos; .
However , the pre @-@ requi@@ site for such an approach would be the availability in restaurants and shops of machines where the code could be entered .
The bad news was that Commissioner Fischler once again stated that Finland has unfortunately not produced sufficient evidence .
I would therefore like to put one question to the Commissioner .
Finally , throughout the whole Court of Auditors &apos; report the point of view is much too narrow .
The fact that the Community has shared in the costs of re @-@ struc@@ turing the economy of the G@@ DR and has provided proof of its solidarity with the people of the G@@ DR in this way is very much to be welcomed .
The British Presidency , as your speech made clear , has no clear project , which of course also means that there is no failure to be recorded .
Please , Mr Santer , please , Mr Cook , make sure that after the Cardiff summit we have obligatory legislation and that environmental policy is an integral component of all other Community policies !
It is not always the same country .
Tom Spen@@ cer mentioned the Middle East peace process .
However , the effect of the other two amendments would be to require replacement registration documents when certain new spare parts were installed in the vehicle , including for example a replacement window .
They are the flag@@ ship of Europe .
We are all aware that the existing framework programme , its special programmes and the existing contribution and dissemination rules exp@@ ire at the end of the year .
In spite of everything , I consider this to be relatively satisfactory .
The Commission considers that the proposed procedure utili@@ zing a committee of representatives to the Member States will give the required flexibility and appropriate rig@@ our for the examination of any proposals to modify the annex .
It applies only to 13 species , as opposed to the 19 covered by the new agreement .
The Commission is aware of this problem but pre@@ fers to deal with it within the framework of Agenda 2000 .
Mr President , Commissioner , the report by our honourable friend Mr Cun@@ ha includes two particular goals : firstly , the comprehensive approach to farming , and secondly , the ability of farms to survive and adapt , and the strengthening of this ability .
The Austrian Presidency is determined to have the main points of the reform ready for judgement before the Council Summit in Vienna so that the whole package can be adopted early in 1999 .
This applies equally to the actual change@@ over period .
Mr President , Mrs C@@ eder@@ schi@@ ö@@ ld , the provisions of the internal market do not prec@@ lu@@ de Member States from exercising domestic controls .
We should therefore investigate the method to see whether best practice models and bench@@ marks could not be included so that we can see how an opportunity for Europe can be developed in the various educational possibilities offered .
I am thinking in particular of the group of amendments relating generally to the implementation and management of the Framework Programme .
The practical effects of our past proposals have been rather small .
I made the check on B. I was then asked to make a check on A. If there had been no objection I would also have made one on A , even though it had been requested rather late on .
The UN Charter was written in 1945 , at a very different time , and is now out of date in this respect .
To content ourselves now with sending observers would be a classic example of a lu@@ ke@@ warm gesture , of an in@@ effec@@ tual attitude , of shame@@ ful co@@ war@@ dice .
The question of harmonization has not yet been raised in any of the three selected priority areas , which are therefore limited to coordination here and there .
I am also delighted at the adoption of a code of conduct in the area of business taxation by the Ecofin Council .
The first is to update the provisions of earlier directives on tax exemptions for vehicles imported from one Member State to another and tax exemptions applicable to permanent import from one Member State to another of the personal property of individuals .
We seek also to improve bilateral communications between Member States in the case of a dispute about a person &apos;s place of residence .
The USA may perhaps present four standards which will lead to a split in their market .
It is important .
Finally it might just see the light .
Cardiff was nevertheless an important and positive meeting .
I believe that the ultimate test is that we have launched the euro with tranquillity and cal@@ m@@ ness , with people understanding there will be stability in the euro @-@ zone .
Mr President , just before the President @-@ in @-@ Office leaves the Chamber .
All of the circumstances surrounding the far@@ ci@@ cal trial which took place are extremely suspi@@ cious and it is not clear how the u@@ pris@@ ing itself began or developed .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , although we do not yet have sufficient information to enable us to make a detailed and objective analysis of the recent situation in Guinea @-@ Bis@@ sau , nevertheless we would wish at this point to express our sad@@ ness at the serious events that have been taking place in that country , and especially the high number of deaths that have resulted from those events .
We need to re@@ introduce some level of capital control and not turn ourselves into a completely open space for multinationals , which is what Europe is being turned into .
Despite all mis@@ gi@@ v@@ ings , we in the Committee on Fisheries have come to the view that industrial fishing is nevertheless acceptable , providing it is carried out in moder@@ ation , and in a proper and controlled manner , especially since we would not wish to disp@@ ense with its products .
We have a whole series of inter@@ locking problems with the whole question of a free market and the idea of protecting the interests of those who are dependent on fisheries in a particular area .
I would also refer the Commissioner to paragraphs 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 21 . In particular , in paragraphs 14 to 17 , Mr McCar@@ tin &apos;s report refers to the need to maintain a system of protection for the Community market .
It is also the case that in 1995 the Member States themselves decided not to extend the procedure for awar@@ ding carry @-@ over payments in favour of the s@@ ard@@ ine industry , precisely because the operators and the Member States no longer wished to favour this sector over others , in view of everything that had been done already .
This is a strange way to behave .
The Commission cannot sit sil@@ ently between the Council and Parliament and say wh@@ ich@@ ever is stronger will win .
Those purchasing goods above the permitted duty @-@ fee sum find that they have not paid VAT after all , as the shop@@ keeper will have paid it .
There would be job losses across all sectors ; price rises in both air and sea travel ; higher access costs for travel ; threats to the viability of year @-@ round ferry services to and from Ireland .
But I wonder if people in Europe actually know about this ?
A computer cannot tell who is sitting on the other side of the screen and it is not limited to certain times .
Let it be known that the ch@@ ris@@ tian democrats were standard bear@@ ers of the socially @-@ orient@@ ated market economy and I know from experience that allowing social partners responsibilities leads to a successful society .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Commissioner &apos;s speech brings this debate to a close .
And in many cases they represent alternative forms of corporation related to traditional economic and social models .
And , although the matter was referred back to CO@@ RE@@ PER and the Austrian Presidency at the last Council of 4 June , it should be noted that negotiations within the Council have already reached an advanced stage and a good number of the European Parliament &apos;s concerns have been taken into consideration .
That is all for that quote .
In short , these fair trade projects are good for the developing countries , often even better than ordinary investment projects and ordinary trade projects .
Firstly , I should like to thank Mr Fass@@ a for his excellent report ; next I would like to emphasize the importance of this instrument to a North / South cooperation policy ; and , finally , I would like to say that many of the suggestions put forward will certainly be included in the communication which the Commission intends to present in a few months &apos; time .
The whi@@ ff of feder@@ alism also im@@ pregn@@ ates some suggestions in favour of so @-@ called European citizenship , one element of which is &quot; the recognition of the right for foreign residents to vote and stand in municipal elections &apos; , and supports at the first opportunity &quot; the un@@ restricted application of the provisions of the Treaty on the right to vote for Community residents &apos; .
For this reason I tabled an amendment in the Committee on Regional Policy ( recital R ) , which at least mentions the NGOs in this context .
Given the diversity of our European regions , we absolutely must encourage economic cohesion by providing wholly appropriate trans @-@ European transport and communication networks , in spite of the many problems which persist .
For these reasons it is logical for us to abstain from voting on recital G .
Once this prem@@ ise has been put forward , the rights and duties of the various players in the democratic process must be specified , because exercising citizenship is that as well .
However , we reject the report as a whole because we reject the institution of Union citizenship in itself because we do not have a European people .
I would like to hear the President &apos;s comments as to why it was not printed , and whether it may be printed in the next issue of the magazine .
Only by doing this can we really justify our request , in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam , to be involved in decision @-@ making within the third pillar after the 5 @-@ year transitional period has exp@@ ired .
This is a fundamental right and all the EU &apos;s Member States have both a collective responsibility and collective commitments by virtue of a number of international agreements .
Toler@@ ance is an obvious starting point .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily , the European Union has to some extent supported preliminary efforts now to solve these enormous problems .
The Commission proposal concerning the composition of the Economic and Financial Committee due to succeed the Monetary Committee actually conve@@ ys an innocent impression of continuity .
This being the case , we can only wonder how someone elected from a single European list , say a Portuguese Member of the European Parliament , could actively run things , for example , in the Å@@ land Islands .
I think that those were the most important questions , if I am not mistaken .
As regards the central administration &apos;s contribution , in 1995 and 1996 the relevant head@@ ings were not provided , perhaps because people were mistak@@ en@@ ly awaiting the accumulation of aid .
Therefore Questions Nos 62 to 114 will be dealt with in writing .
It was difficult at the start .
It is to those structures , which the decision now puts in place , that those citizens can confi@@ dently look for re@@ assurance that the sort of kil@@ ler diseases re @-@ emerging to sometimes worrying degrees in other continents , as well as here , are less likely to strike them down .
You do not need me to tell you that Austria shares almost half its borders with four candidate countries .
Until now , it has just been part of the ly@@ ric poetry , as I like to call it , in many European speeches .
There may well be a big row over this , if my information about the present state of negotiations in CO@@ RE@@ PER and in other bodies is correct .
I have discussed this with the propos@@ er and we have agreed that this could be done as an addition , so that the text in the English version would read : energy , for example , emission of carbon dioxide .
From this perspective , a harmonization of the essential elements of national electoral procedures - in the sense of the gener@@ alized use of proportional representation by constituency for the European elections - , combined with the introduction of a minimum threshold of represent@@ ati@@ veness - aimed at avoiding too much fragmentation of the political group@@ ings - appears to be the best solution since the British government has put a bill to its parliament establishing proportional and regional voting for the 1999 European elections .
Obviously , as stated by the previous speakers , starting with the rapporteur , Mr Four@@ ç@@ ans , whose report we support , this has been useful for a first exchange of views on the first steps of the European Central Bank , which has been undergoing a process of consolidation since 1 June this year .
I further assume that we will have a great many more discussions about which monetary policy is really suited to guaranteeing the necessary future investments in Europe and the development of employment that we urgently need .
Secondly , the complex matter that we will discuss is the question of the democratic integration of the European Central Bank and the ES@@ C@@ B .
We even had the lu@@ dic@@ rous situation last week , Mr Duisenberg , where someone en@@ qui@@ red what your salary was as President of the Central Bank , and was unable to find out that information .
Mr President , the main principle of the European Central bank is neo @-@ liber@@ alist ideology .
However , the transportation of live animals for slaughter must also be carried out under good conditions , because the quality of the meat depends on this .
I will quote this once again because this is precisely what is at issue here .
The Commission is guardian of the Treaties .
With the extension of codecision , I believe that there must be more flu@@ idity , more flexibility . If Parliament has tabled amendments , the Council must take them into consideration , examine them , and determine how formul@@ as can be found to reach agreement , while avoiding conciliation which is usually a particularly rare formula .
However , paragraphs 10 to 12 cause some difficulty .
It is then very strange , of course , when you hear from that side of the House that we are responsible for dela@@ ying this matter .
I would encourage the Members of this House to av@@ ail of this instrument more often .
I would like to point out that many of these languages were banned in certain countries during very recent dictator@@ ships , but democracy has recognized them and has also granted them their own official status .
At this stage , it is therefore important for us to signal politically what we expect from the Commission in the proposal on openness which the Commission should put forward supported by Article 19@@ 1@@ a of the Amsterdam Treaty regarding the right of access to documents .
His job has , in many ways , brought the citizens of Europe closer to us , an aspi@@ ration we continually speak about here in Parliament .
And I ask this . Could the Commission perhaps give us some initial thoughts on the matter ?
Ex@@ changes and joint projects in the area of vocational training are especially important during the period of difficult economic adjustment .
This is an increase which is out of all proportion with the demographic development of the country .
Clearly , to fight organized crime effectively , it is important to have international instruments that are not merely based on &apos; best endeavour &apos; undertakings but are authentic and well@@ defined legal obligations that can protect society and deter or , indeed , pun@@ ish the vil@@ la@@ ins .
The Commission is aware of the need to balance effective measures against money laundering with protection of individuals &apos; genuine rights .
The exchange programmes which have already begun have started to build a basis for this growth in the Community .
First of all we should remember that we are dealing with an extremely poor part of the world : half a million people with a GDP per capita of something like ECU 600 annually or 3 % of the European Union average .
Th@@ ei@@ rs is an un@@ settled political situation as well .
How many days did all this tonn@@ age of vessels fish in these waters , what did they catch and where did they land it ?
DG I had in fact indicated , following the majority vote in favour of this report in the Committee on Budgetary Control on 4 September , that it would be put on the agenda .
I and other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have now received , about an hour ago , a detailed dossier from Mr Tro@@ jan with opinions on the relevant questions , which were raised in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The Association of European Airlines has gone so far as to intimate that a certain sense of com@@ plac@@ ency exists in some governments , particularly the British Government , about seriously tackling the problem of air con@@ gestion .
If so , is this done with the knowledge and agreement of other Member States ?
It has now come to our attention that an agreement may have been concluded in the European Union in 1995 whereby the secret services of EU Member States would acquire the use of the Ech@@ el@@ on system via the F@@ BI - the American intelligence service - and the N@@ SA .
I am not hiding in any way .
We already started this discussion last autumn , when the Commission took a very positive stance on decentrali@@ sation , which it said it wanted and was prepared to implement .
I should like to hear what the Commissioner has to say about the voluntary agreement she has secured here with the automobile industry concerning CO2 .
Are we correctly informed that 12 Environment Ministers have already jum@@ ped ship on this issue and that only three are still on board ?
These are amendments of intent , nothing more , but which I believe bring an improvement to the directive .
EU ministers asked the Commission to investigate the status and role of pan @-@ European geographic information ( GI ) in 1994 .
We shall be presenting this communication .
Let us bring power back to the people , back to Parliament , where it should be ; to censure c@@ ommis@@ sions ; to criticise decisions .
Speci@@ fic measures must be taken , concerning both the organisation and financing of the event , and we do not really have the time and resources available .
That is curious , and it suggests that narrow thought does not help us understand reality , even less control it .
I would like to see Parliament , the Commission and the Council take an initiative early in the new year to press for reform of the Brett@@ on Woods institutions .
The development of the world economy is no longer determined by G7 meetings .
Val@@ ver@@ de L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z report ( A4 @-@ 0@@ 27@@ 9 / 98 )
I promise you that the Commission will make every effort to get the report out as swiftly as possible .
Unfortunately , as it turns out , the international community &apos;s efforts here have proved inadequate .
At the informal Council of Foreign Ministers &apos; meeting in Salzburg , the European Commission agreed to investigate any loop@@ holes in the current sanctions by the time of the October Council summit and to propose improvements .
So far , the international community has rather confined itself to the role of an observer , while a new danger is now on the horizon , namely the recent and very worrying events in Albania , which affect Greece a great deal ; Greece , which has a lot of very strange neighbours , though we often forget that here . If these events continue , they may trigger chain reactions .
An agreement to that effect would enable the parties to resume the negotiations on the final status of the Palestinian autonomous area , which are due to be completed by 4 March 1999 according to the original timetable .
I must admit that the Member States are being very reluctant about this .
The first contradiction is that there have never before been so many women in paid employment outside of the home ; at the same time , neither have there ever been so many women out of work .
The same can be said of vocational training , which does not lead to significant levels of female employment when it is targeted at sectors already dominated by women , nor even , sometimes , when targeted at sectors dominated by men , if these sectors are themselves contracting .
It is true that some are in favour of part @-@ time work for women as it enables them to reconcile professional and family life .
Are we going to accept the global model where only 20 % of human beings will be really needed and the other 80 % , the majority of them women , will be a sort of surplus population ?
It comprises experts from the Member States and has only an advisory role .
Mr President , as Mr Swoboda said , the European Union helped Albania to acquire a democratically elected government in order to create and establish democratic institutions after the crisis a year earlier .
Our credibility has suffered greatly , and we should at long last present a more resol@@ ute front to the dictator , Milosevic , and commit ourselves more strongly to finding a solution in Kosovo .
Later , on 9 September , the Presidency of the European Union issued a statement on behalf of the European Union condemning the detention of opposition activists , a statement that obviously deserves the Commission &apos;s full support .
It should not take long , given your very capable chair@@ manship .
Madam President , I had asked to speak during the votes .
We paid particular attention to that when ministers and interested groups came together , particularly in Belfast and then in Inn@@ s@@ br@@ ück .
Article 10 of the Protocol on the Privi@@ leges and Imm@@ unities of the European Communities does indeed say that , during the sessions of the European Parliament , Members shall enjoy immunity in the territory of other Member States .
It incorporates much of what our drugs expert , Sir Jack Ste@@ wart @-@ Clark , proposed and lays great emphasis on the social aspect .
The UK has many f@@ aults , failure to support decommission@@ ing and many other things , but Spain has f@@ aults too .
It is not only a question of guaranteeing the democratic accountability of an institution which enjoys a historically unprecedented degree of autonomy ; conver@@ sely , it is also about the fact that only a policy backed by the public acceptance and credibility that comes from democratic legitimacy can achieve the goals imposed upon it by the Treaty .
We also welcome the fact that in his report our rapporteur has asked that priority be given to a common conversion policy for the entire European statistical system .
Finally , I too am optimistic that the euro will have a positive effect on the drawing @-@ up of the Community budget , as well as on Community staff management . Sal@@ aries and pensions will be calculated on a constant basis , no longer subject to the v@@ ag@@ aries of exchange rates .
UCLAF
This certificate has elu@@ ded the Commission and all other bodies over the years since the Maastricht Treaty brought it into being but I see this agency as being a candidate for taking the blue ri@@ b@@ bon very soon .
So my question is this : do you indeed believe that those responsible for this loss , whether it be the organis@@ ers or in@@ vigil@@ ators , or those sitting the examination , must bear the cost of the loss which the institution has sustained ?
According to the terms of reference and normal Commission practice , the services gave their comments to ensure that all the reports were clear and complete .
In spring 1998 an informal working group was set up with the ACP secretariat for ex@@ changing information , discussing and possibly coordinating positions for the next WTO negotiating round .
Mr President , the Commission has done everything possible to present all the proposals that could be put forward in the context of agreements within the Commission and in the Member States , to give a powerful impetus to the use of renewable energy sources .
A bird &apos;s eye look at Europe reveals the dividing line drawn after World War Two between those countries which received Marshall aid and those that did not .
However , many of Malta &apos;s administrative , legal and fiscal structures have already been aligned to European Union standards .
It is possible to catch him , but we have not done so , and all of a sudden we are being all pragmatic and wanting to threaten Milosevic with air strikes .
What did it do in 1956 when Soviet tanks violated Hungary &apos;s sovereignty and entered Budapest ?
I do actually believe that it is quite legitimate to ask whether , in the event of a negotiated solution being implemented , a multinational peace @-@ keeping force on the ground might be appropriate , on the Bosni@@ an model for example .
Therefore , I do not think that there is any justification for postp@@ oning this report , which obviously affects the normal functioning of the institutions involved .
Recent revel@@ ations of irregularities and corruption within the Commission under@@ score the need for visi@@ bly tou@@ gher supervision of activities - managed by the Commission or the Member States - paid for out of Community funds .
The best way of combating fraud and corruption within the Commission is to enshr@@ ine the principle of full openness and transparency .
The other major component of budget expenditure is the common agricultural policy , which is not intended as a means of re@@ distributing wealth between Member States .
Amendment No 6 is not considered workable with the timing envisaged ; in broad terms its objective is covered by the general obligation on the Commission to ensure comple@@ ment@@ arity and coherence .
This would undoubtedly constitute a saving but only in the very short term and it would not take into account the social cost - in addition to the economic cost - that it would inevitably also entail .
But the Commission can accept the first part of Amendment No 8 , and Amendment No 7 too with one small change of wording .
I have already explained how I voted and the importance of implementing a specific policy in the fight against pollution @-@ related diseases , and therefore the fight against pollution .
T@@ as@@ lim@@ a Nas@@ re@@ en -B4 @-@ 09@@ 06 / 98 by Mr Collins and Mrs van Bla@@ del , on behalf of the Union for Europe Group , on T@@ as@@ lim@@ a Nas@@ re@@ en ; -B4 @-@ 09@@ 20 / 98 by Mr Tel@@ kämp@@ er and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on T@@ as@@ lim@@ a Nas@@ re@@ en ; -B4 @-@ 09@@ 34 / 98 by Mrs L@@ enz and others , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on T@@ as@@ lim@@ a Nas@@ re@@ en ; -B4 @-@ 09@@ 39 / 98 by Mrs González Á@@ lv@@ are@@ z and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , on the death threats lev@@ elled at T@@ as@@ lim@@ a Nas@@ re@@ en ;
Far@@ mers throughout Europe see the European Union as being responsible for agriculture .
Moreover , if we considered such aid , we would first have to reach agreement at international level , to ensure that a food aid programme was not charged to our exports , landing us in further difficulties .
It brings us a step closer to completing the single market .
This has become clear from the activities of the Commission services and various Court of Justice judgments .
Our everyday existence is mar@@ red by too many accidents , so improvements are welcome .
I therefore call on the Commission to take the initiative to introduce common nit@@ rogen le@@ vies in the EU , with the explicit pro@@ viso that the proceeds of such le@@ vies be passed back to the Member States .
There has been a legal vacuum here since 1997 , because the arrangements were in force until December 1997 .
For this reason we have decided , through an amendment signed by the chair@@ men of the two largest groups and by myself , to release EUR 5 m from the reserve . This will be discussed tomorrow .
We are going to leave no margin .
All the political groups have had a policy of no increases in personnel in all the institutions , and that should also apply to the Court of Justice .
It should therefore come as no surprise that we are rejecting this strategy today , as we have always rejected it , and its consequences on the budget . Let us say right away that the problem is not so much what we shall be voting for on Thursday but far more what we are not voting for .
It has been applied in varying degrees since the 1970s .
I urge all Members of the House not to tolerate any further delay in reforming the payment of expenses , and to undo this connection .
It actually genuinely undermines democracy and the principle of subsidiarity , it undermines our individual freedoms , those of our regions and those of our nations .
In particular , I said right at the outset that , as far as we were concerned , the primary forum for such an agreement should be the WTO .
Then it will be up to you how quickly you can deal with it .
Many @-@ headed gi@@ ants are only frigh@@ tening in fair@@ y @-@ tales .
On the one hand , it is called upon to take the lead where the budget , legislative and political issues are concerned , and on the other it must , in a spirit of loyalty , fully accept Parliament &apos;s control .
The Member States have already demonstrated that with their national action plans for employment .
There were very solid reasons why the Treaty of Amsterdam made them applicable to employment .
After all , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , we have to accept that the short @-@ term economic forecasts have been revised worldwide .
The priorities for P@@ ör@@ tsch@@ ach and Vienna are very clear to us .
Its independence and right of initiative must be safeguarded .
If P@@ ör@@ tsch@@ ach is to become a summit of missed opportunities , then I would ask you to consider , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , that the loss of credibility and sense of disappointment may lead people to ask : &apos; what for ? &apos; .
But every market needs a regulatory framework if society is not to be damaged , and I would remind you that the money for the people does exist .
And it was our troops who failed , and were failed .
It is proving a lab@@ orious process , we are seeing that , and there remains the risk that interested groups will once again try to infl@@ ame the conflict .
Sup@@ pose Belgrade fails to honour the agreement , will the international community , will NATO risk a military intervention with 2 000 veri@@ fiers on the ground ?
I , for my part , tried to keep the report brief .
So at this initial stage , I would urge that we do not block the way to further discussions by laying down rules that are too specific .
In its extensive case law , the European Court of Justice has many times clarified and decided in individual cases the conditions under which legitimate non @-@ economic interests can be recognised in the interest of the general good .
There is no link between the first vote and the vote concerning the statute for Members .
What we have now is a situation where Members are free to pocket any surplus allowance that is not needed for travel .
I have just spoken to Mr Medina who tells me there is a law in Spain which says that you cannot go to prison if you are over 80 years of age .
It seems to me that the political question this afternoon is not the rule of law but the effectiveness of legal institutions at global level .
That seems more appealing to me than sitting at a desk looking at all sorts of electronic documents on a screen .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is fully aware of the significance of sign language for hearing @-@ impa@@ ired people .
But the Commission cannot be alone in bearing the consequences of its conduct .
Mr President , I have here today as my guest , and as the guest of many Members , the D@@ air@@ y Trade Co@@ alition from the United States of America .
I am not saying that the Commission was not right to do this .
Not to include this clause seemed unrealistic and un@@ reasonable to the Court at the time .
Nevertheless , the Commission wishes to maintain its initial position in the case of 14 amendments , which are as follows .
But I do not think this instrument is necessarily going to achieve that overnight .
The Commission proposed ECU 1 400 million in funding for the next five year period .
I welcome these projects very much and hope the Commission will do more to ensure that the education euros really do reach more Europeans .
Working people will be attacked on two fron@@ ts : by the national authorities and by &apos; private individuals who would be affected &apos; .
The Europe of &apos; free movement &apos; cannot with@@ stand action by ships &apos; cre@@ ws fighting to prevent their labour rights from being reduced to third @-@ world levels .
The matter was put before Parliament &apos;s Bureau , as you requested in your letter .
Frau@@ d against the Community is after all , according to this view , money lost to the Community budget and not the national budgets .
Pre@@ vention is an extremely important factor and is linked to the quality of pen@@ al institutions and their ability to assist the social re@@ integration of offen@@ ders .
I really do think that we need to have a special report on this area , and I think that instead of going on talking about these things and emplo@@ ying expensive consultants and a good deal more besides , we should employ people ourselves and send them out there to start the necessary process .
On closer study , however , we see that unemployment has fallen to a lesser degree than the economy has grown in the same period .
We will continue with the votes , and to avoid up@@ setting Mr Fab@@ re @-@ Au@@ b@@ resp@@ y I will mention that this time , most of the separate votes were requested by the Socialist Group .
Sometimes we in Parliament feel that we are presented with a fait accom@@ pl@@ i agreed by the social partners , and that this is political black@@ mail - we cannot oppose it because the social partners have agreed it .
They were more ambitious . I do not apologise for that .
Structural dialogue between parliamentary delegations and Members of Parliament may perhaps put an end to this .
We must defend employment and our industries , and this would mean strengthening their solidarity before the negotiations start .
I would stress that , in this case , none of the information which has so far come to light justi@@ fies such action .
Mr President , the amendments proposed by the European Commission are to be welcomed , since they are designed to help the vis@@ ually impa@@ ired , to protect consumers and to th@@ wart counterfei@@ ters , as the rapporteur has indicated .
Firstly , the weight of the 50 cent coin must be increased slightly to allow easier differenti@@ ation between it and the 20 cent coin , and secondly , the definition of the edges of the 10 and 50 cent coins must be changed by replacing the co@@ ar@@ se m@@ illing with a shaped edge with fine sc@@ allo@@ ps .
We therefore call for a consul@@ tative committee to be set up made up of experts from the 15 Member States and the applicant countries .
In the light of the irregularities that have occurred in connection with PHARE , I am against supporting agriculture in the Central and Eastern European countries with funds from that programme while EU farmers have to accept massive losses as a result of Agenda 2000 .
The 1994 reform ensured a common approach to all Union areas dependent on fisheries .
The result of this will be enormous programming difficulties in the fisheries sector and serious risks of relocation of enterprises , as they will establish themselves in those regions where there are regional programmes or where the regional programmes are more favourable to them .
The effects of Hurri@@ cane Mit@@ ch call for measures at two levels : firstly at the level of humanitarian emergency aid and , secondly , at the level of long @-@ term reconstruction aid for the countries concerned .
They need a far @-@ sighted reconstruction plan to be drawn up , not a pat@@ ch@@ work of gift packages which , as we have seen in the past , se@@ ep away into dubious or government @-@ chosen channels .
Can he also tell us what the situation is with the hospital in Gaza that was built with European funding ?
Could you confirm whether it is true that Eurostat will be producing new figures in the next couple of days providing the economic indicators for 1996 @-@ 1997 ?
Madam President , first let me thank Mrs J@@ ön@@ s for her extremely thorough report on our proposal for a Council regulation on the European Social Fund .
The system is also acting as a deter@@ rent to young people making a career in farming .
Paragraph 6 , as well as several other amendments , all refer to distribution in relation to population density .
I will be using my vote to condemn a Community agricultural policy that basically adher@@ es to a rationale of reducing prices and lowering the value accord@@ ed to labour , a policy that is so destructive that it calls into question the CAP itself by proposing the cofinancing of agricultural spending .
It wishes to meet the new challenges facing mankind in the areas of food , energy , the environment , water supply and sustainable development .
That is why , Commissioner , we must unfortunately reject these two proposals .
If that is what Parliament really wants , then we have to give some careful thought to our role !
Ei@@ ght countries from five different continents , very varied in terms of size and political relationships , are seeking to intervene in nuclear disarmament .
That effectively blocks the situation .
Thank you .
Lastly , there is the matter of the obstacles that are preventing the emergence of a genuine - and I mean genuine - pan @-@ European capital investment market , which Cardiff called for and which could be a real source of job creation because of the capital it could generate for innovative undertakings .
Mo@@ cho@@ v@@ ce is certain to attract our attention , and Boh@@ uni@@ ce is a permanent source of concern and worry for the public .
This requirement has clearly not been met ; this proposal does have financial implications for the Community budget and there has been no suggestion of how to finance it .
The Chair believes that the report we are about to debate is admissible as the Council has expressly asked for our opinion on this matter and , according to the Rules , this is a valid way to give our opinion .
From where can we draw the strength we need for this step on the road to Europe ?
On Amendment No 106
However , Amendment No 26 has been adopted by the House , which thus establishes the transitional regime .
Mr President , in this context I think we should bear in mind that Article 190 ( 5 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam does not specify a majority for this kind of question .
Therefore , only a simple majority is needed for this document to be adopted .
Sa@@ y the present proposal were to mean a salary of approximately SK@@ R 56 000 - an increase for Swedish Members of some SK@@ R 26 000 - the new system for reimbur@@ sement of travel expenses would lead to some Swedish Members losing out if a common system of allowances and expenses were introduced , since their tax @-@ free profit on travel would disappear .
When a citizens stands as an MEP he should accept the salary on offer .
C@@ acc@@ av@@ ale report ( A4 @-@ 04@@ 30 / 98 )
So I imagine it was a mistake that Rec@@ ital g ) , which received 270 votes , was declared adopted , and likewise Amendment No 84 to the Annex , with 264 votes , Article 1 ( 1 ) of the Annex , with 25@@ 1 votes for the first part and 2@@ 12 for the second , Article 2 of the Annex , with 27@@ 9 votes for the first part and 28@@ 8 for the second , Article 8 ( 1 ) of the Annex , with 3@@ 11 votes , and , finally , Article 5 of the Annex , with 2@@ 97 votes .
Parliament is supporting the allocation of ECU 400 m for emergency food aid to Russia as the Council wanted , but on condition that distribution is guaranteed , action is taken to prevent fraud and the food reaches the need@@ y .
Ultimately there has to be some result .
But we do not think explicit links need to be established at legislative level between the various actions and excessively precise country categories .
Whether we still wish to grant discharge in the light of these facts - which belong in 1996 and can no longer be altered for that financial year - is something which the following criteria must decide : firstly , there must be a real improvement in the way in which the European Union operates in the region ; secondly , comprehensive information about the measures taken should also be provided , so that Parliament has a clear understanding of where improvements have been made and where the weaknesses remain .
Never before have we seen so many officials den@@ ounce anony@@ mously to Members of Parliament what they see , what they hear .
The Committee on Budgets is now proposing not to have this enormous reserve , which is sensible because Parliament would risk being condemned by the Court if it persi@@ sted in this dangerous course .
The agricultural proposals , as represented in Agenda 2000 , are not satisfactory , particularly from an Irish perspective .
However , as far as the assessment is concerned , I must point out - and I say this with some pride , perhaps not justified in every case , but with a certain degree of pride all the same - that , for the first time , of the 34 new legislative initiatives scheduled in our action programme for 1998 , 30 were actually put forward , in other words 88 % .
I particularly appreciate her reference to the need for social measures in order to drive progress in terms of society .
As for the other aspect , I have just said that a few weeks ago , when I was in Madrid , I managed to secure Mr Pi@@ qu@@ é &apos;s agreement to ensure that Mr Pap@@ out@@ sis is notified of how the transitional measures are funded not only under the directive but also in the form of state aid .
To my mind , the choice between a transitional period of a few weeks and one big change @-@ over day all at once largely determines the way in which information on the euro should be given to our citizens .
But if you want to check all this again , I would ask you to inform me of the fact as soon as possible , in case there are any other procedures to be followed .
As a result , the important meetings in Cologne , Tampere and Helsinki have gained momentum .
It will make our citizens more involved with Europe , but I do not think that the farmers , who do a great deal for our quality of life , should be made to suffer as a result .
To deal with crises at national and Community level and to harmonise the economies , harmonisation of tax policy is advanced as an essential element . This will mean new burdens for working people who in one way or another and in any event will be called upon to bear the cost of economic and monetary union , the euro , economic recession and the crises .
The European Union has also advised the parties concerned to work closely together with the High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es , and in particular to enable him to carry out all the necessary preliminary work for the return of the Sah@@ ra@@ wi refugees .
Mr President , if we adopt this report today , the main reason will be its political fore@@ sight and its success in picking up on what is essential and setting aside rigid ideological considerations , so as to grasp the opportunity of having a report which r@@ allies a broad consensus .
Consumer considerations should always have top priority .
These mur@@ ders are taking place against a background of serious political confrontation in Iran between President K@@ hat@@ ami and the powerful conservative government .
With regard to the reference made by the rapporteur in paragraph 8 of the Oostlander report , the Charter of European political parties for a non @-@ racist society is not receiving the support it deserves either at European level or in Member States .
But we must also recognise that the lack of a transparent set of rules governing relations between Commissioners , their cab@@ in@@ ets and their direc@@ tor@@ ates @-@ general has fu@@ elled claims of ne@@ po@@ tism , patron@@ age and financial gain .
Only if it changes its behaviour in this radical way can the Commission recre@@ ate a climate of trust between itself and the European Parliament and all the Union &apos;s institutions .
Again , I ask why do we have to wait for a crisis to provo@@ ke action ?
We want more Europe .
Under the last German Presidency in 1994 it was agreed to coordinate national measures .
But to be in opposition also means to attack very intel@@ lig@@ ently and make it difficult for the government to find a reply .
The fact that the Deutsch@@ mark became integrated in the euro is not a matter of course , given its significance as a national currency , a significance that goes far beyond what a national currency normally signi@@ fies , and not just for the West Germans but also and in particular for our East German comp@@ atri@@ ots since unification in 1989 / 1990 .
Allow me to correct a few other words you said .
I do not agree with it because the institutional consequences of this proposal have not been thought through and because it makes the dilemma of our method of integration quite g@@ lar@@ ingly obvious .
After all , in the transition to a market economy , they must first develop their own national competition law .
Any visitor to the country today will notice the progress which has been made towards a market economy .
We are not in fact talking about state aid here , although I shall be coming back to this shortly .
We do not have any direct responsibility here .
Let me now turn to the individual amendments you have proposed .
To think in these terms amounts to a blat@@ ant refusal to acknowledge the wi@@ dening gap between the aspirations of farmers and citizens of the Union for more jobs , higher incomes and a better quality of life , and the Commission &apos;s ultra @-@ liberal ambitions .
On the one hand , the proposal would transfer the emphasis from the cities - which are supposed to be the focus of the event - to countries , and on the other , the Council procedure undermines the position of the European Parliament .
An efficient port system can also constitute a local and regional development factor , particularly in out@@ lying and insul@@ ar areas . In addition to bringing these out@@ lying areas closer to the centre , it is a dominant factor in economic and social cohesion .
They are therefore not acceptable unless they are amended as my group has recommended .
I should like to look at a number of points that were raised , without d@@ w@@ elling on them too long , particularly as some of them were addressed to me .
Applause
There is an internal Council document which was to be discussed .
I know that from Denmark and from Germany .
Only three Member States - Germany , Luxembourg and the Netherlands - guarantee the right to full de@@ duction , the only exception of course being expenditure which has no business element .
Many people believe that it is important to combine the European and American approaches .
I know that you have high expectations of me over the coming months - and thank you for your good wishes .
Through sponsor@@ ship , product placement and image transfer , the influence of advertising and marketing has long been felt throughout the world of communication and inter@@ personal contact - in feature films and schools , for example . The net result is de facto domin@@ ance of the mighty and powerful over the smaller and weaker .
The other side was the discussion of measures for temporary refuge and sharing of the burden between Member States in accepting refugees , particularly those fle@@ eing from civil wars . These proposals were put forward by the Commission in July and considered by the European Parliament in December , and the German Presidency intends to move them forward with all speed .
On enlargement , I would like to refer to two particularly important measures : on 28 May 1998 the Council adopted the Pre @-@ Acc@@ ession Pact on Organ@@ ised Cri@@ me between the Member States of the European Union and the applicant CE@@ EC@@ s and Cyprus . The German word for pre @-@ accession pact is one of those interesting new words that the bureau@@ crats are always inv@@ enting , and I nearly mis@@ pronounced it so that it came out as pre @-@ c@@ ession !
I have a particular answer for Mr Nass@@ auer .
We naturally welcome the progress made in 1998 , although we know that despite everything this progress was made at a sn@@ ail &apos;s pace rather than the fast pace we would have liked .
The armed forces - except for those of UN@@ IT@@ A - were not confined to bar@@ ra@@ cks .
However , the Government of Morocco is still rejecting them .
I can certainly recall visits by several delegations in the EC @-@ ASEAN framework , for example in the early days of Mrs Aqu@@ ino &apos;s government . At that time we gave strong backing to the process .
I see a great opportunity in the development of renewable bio @-@ energy and wood energy technologies , and the logistics know @-@ how associated with this whole sector , in the development strategies for countries like these .
The growth of the 15 Member States in 1998 was 0.1 % higher than predicted in March 1998 .
In the long term we need constructive transatlantic dialogue because only if we preserve free trade in goods and observe the rules of fair competition on both sides of the Atlantic , will we be able to guarantee a stable global environment .
This is something we must strive to achieve .
This means that by the end of 1999 an action plan will be drawn up on how European agriculture will contribute to safeguarding biodiversity .
The saf@@ est world is a world in which disarmament is wri@@ t large , which is why we should not play one aspect off against the other .
Local and regional ecological problems can have serious implications for international relations , for example limited water resources or the large @-@ scale displac@@ ement of environmental refugees .
In that sense , there is indeed a need for closer links and correspondence between the competition policy and the European Union &apos;s regional policy .
Madam President , I should like to congratulate the speakers , the Commissioner and his department on their reports .
Madam President , it is consumers and citizens who are the tou@@ ch@@ stone where liberalisation is concerned .
That is why I think it is so important that we do not counter@@ act our own endeavours by wat@@ ering down the 75 % criterion .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , was Buenos Aires a flo@@ p ?
I think that Mr Lin@@ koh@@ r was quite right and that he put his finger on something we may have noticed in these debates .
I am very grateful to Mr T@@ app@@ in for incorporating many of our conclusions into his report .
We did however vote against the amendment on cofinancing , since we think that this would mean a ren@@ ation@@ alisation of the agricultural policy .
This means that the Member States are free to introduce the more stringent limit earlier than the year 2008 .
A plant known as ( ... ) is to be started up in Vila Bo@@ a , not the best choice of site since :
So the Commission has already begun the preparatory work for an initiative on compo@@ sting .
We are in agreement with the model of coexistence and take the view that , as far as the proposed rate is concerned , and subject , of course , to the Council &apos;s prerog@@ atives , the idea of lowering rates in an initial stage from 20 to 15 % could also help prevent the risk of capital flight from the Union .
I therefore have to make it quite clear that , although they may have reservations on some points , Luxembourg and the United Kingdom are participating fully in this process to counter harmful tax competition , the aim of which , as mentioned by Mr Sec@@ chi and other speakers , is not general harmonisation but a concerted effort to counter the harmful effects of tax competition .
In this case , that way has to be sought by ensuring a proper balance between rights and exceptions to those rights .
I should like to say , even at this early stage , that of course my group wishes to support the rapporteur in his efforts to maintain the compromise reached in the committee and to examine with due care all the amendments which could un@@ ravel that compromise .
The danger of this type of xenophobia - it cannot be called anything other than this - is great , for as Gor@@ ki wrote , &apos; it is prefer@@ able to expect the best of man ; expecting the worst will only lead him ast@@ ray &apos; .
Mr Pir@@ ker , on the other hand , is an example of someone quite capable of maintaining all his aggressive prejudi@@ ces despite being in possession of the facts .
Europe will continue to be an attractive destination , a state of affairs we should accept as permanent and normal , instead of regarding it as a passing and somewhat dramatic occurrence .
Jean @-@ Louis Bourlanges has done very good preliminary work in this respect .
At the moment , the ministers responsible for women &apos;s rights cannot meet in a formal Council of Ministers .
I am particularly delighted that my amendment to reduce the level of with@@ holding tax from 20 % to 15 % has been adopted , for three reasons .
The same applies to &apos; economic &apos; immigration , the criteria for which must be laid down very clearly .
It is currently being raised in France in relation to the 1979 directive on the conservation of wild birds . It could be raised tomorrow in relation to the Convention on rules for the admission of third @-@ country nationals , for example , if a signat@@ ory country requests amendments to the rules on family reunification .
I can understand that you would like to be able to discuss concrete agreements now .
The financial resources made available by the Union for this year are limited .
I believe I may say without any arrogan@@ ce but with a certain pride that it was my group that kept pointing out that we need both : the offer of talks and the threat of force .
So we think the most appropriate political and institutional solution would be the wi@@ dest possible autonomy for Kosovo within a constitutional framework which guarantees it , backed by the international institutions and the European Union .
Finally , we must , I think , as Mr W@@ ier@@ sm@@ a has said , avoid the trap of constantly rec@@ iting history in this dispute .
I am convinced that the firm stance adopted by Parliament as the legislative process has progres@@ sed will help us to achieve our goal , which is a water policy we can be proud of .
The Committee on the Environment has proposed 45 amendments , and with a further 16 there is a total of 61 . Some of the amendments clarify or improve the proposal , and I can already say that the Commission is able to accept 20 of them in full or in part .
That brings us to a question I raised in this very House on an article in The Sunday Times , which I actually thought was a ho@@ ax . The article claimed that Israeli researchers had tried to isol@@ ate genes specific to Ara@@ bs in order to be able to use bac@@ teri@@ ological weapons against them .
I think that a collective day of rest is essential if society is to operate successfully , which is why I am pleased that the retention of the ban on weekend driving prevents another group of workers from having to lose their hard @-@ earned rest day on Sunday .
International pressure must be brought to bear on both sides to bring about a new cease @-@ fire for a start .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in this debate on the granting of EUR 20 million in macro @-@ financial assistance to Albania , I think it is extremely important to look at the political and economic context in which the assistance is being provided .
It supplements the actions we have taken under the PHARE programme , the priorities of which are institutional reform .
These reservations do not mean that I think aid should be given with no strings attached .
It is vital that we take action .
Time is short , Mr President , so I will be brief and simply echo what has been said by the presidency and emphasise that the Commission naturally endor@@ ses in every respect the statement adopted last Monday by the Council .
The negotiations proved very difficult from the outset , especially because of the problems on both sides in regard to opening up their agricultural markets and because of the diver@@ gent positions on the use of design@@ ations of origin for port and sher@@ ry produced in South Africa .
They are even tackling the Russians because of their Champ@@ an@@ sky . It is only logical that we should be anxious to protect our own design@@ ations of origin , because these reflect the cum@@ ulative cultural effect of generation upon generation of producers , and this is certainly appreciated by con@@ nois@@ se@@ urs .
Spain raised problems with agriculture .
Socrates enables students and teachers to meet and it also allows cooperation between teaching establishments , improved recognition of qualifications and experience of other European educational systems .
If a blan@@ ket ban is imposed on advertising , there will be no means of adv@@ ising consumers on their best course of action .
So , although I support the Commission &apos;s proposal for internal production control , I do not think it would be right to take this proposed directive any further before the essential requirements have been laid down in C@@ EN standards .
It is true that I spoke to the rapporteur , but I do not know whether he delayed the proposal , Mrs Lulling .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 00@@ 50 / 99 ) by Mrs O@@ j@@ ala , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the 21st annual activity report of the Ad@@ visory Committee on Safety , Hygiene and Health Protection at Work ( 1996 ) ( COM ( 97 ) 07@@ 28 - C4 @-@ 0@@ 18@@ 9 / 98 ) ; the activity report of the permanent body for safety and hygiene in co@@ al@@ mines and other extrac@@ tive industries - 1996 ( COM ( 97 ) 07@@ 29 - C4 @-@ 0@@ 190 / 98 ) ; and@@ the interim report concerning a Community programme in the field of safety , hygiene and health in the workplace ( 1996 @-@ 2000 ) ( COM ( 98 ) 05@@ 11 - C4 @-@ 00@@ 41 / 99 ) .
I believe that is one message that comes across from today &apos;s International Women &apos;s Day .
Credit is therefore due to all those who have worked so hard to bring this proposal before us today .
We want to support research .
Of course we would have to call for considerable transparency on the part of the undertakings , which they are not always prepared to agree to , in order to be able to make these forecasts and projec@@ tions .
The Community framework must be uniform and binding in order to protect the general public . It would have been prefer@@ able if a different form of legal instrument had been chosen which would be more binding than a recommendation , that is , a regulation , directive or decision , as Parliament had requested .
She also asks for gender relevant statistics and for the Member States to act in a similar manner .
This is why I totally support the rapporteur &apos;s proposal calling on Parliament and its political groups to take certain initiatives to effectively promote genuine equal opportunities for men and women within the European Parliament .
Mr President , one of the har@@ dest things to explain to Europeans , when one meets them privately or at public debates , is that the Community has no real competence over health .
I am keen to see what initiatives the Commission will take to meet the growing need for public health policy in the early years of the next century .
Only then could I approve the report .
Along with mills on the borders , a fragile area , they are losing orders of £ 1 million .
Very often the problem is not so much the size of the banana production in these regions or countries but the important part that it plays in their economy or social and environmental fabric .
Mr President , the first question to be asked about the European Union &apos;s own resources is whether they are sufficient for the policies that we intend to implement .
This study will be extended to processed products .
If one is worried about things not being properly run it seems a pity if you adverti@@ se the fact that they are not going to be checked .
Mr President , the history of ferry safety can only be described as scandal : despite the tragic events in the 1950s , 1960s , 1970s and 1980s , next to nothing was done .
Ad@@ mittedly , the Council &apos;s idea of nomin@@ ating cities in turn for each Member State has been preserved , but the direct choice of city to nom@@ inate by the Member State has been abandoned ; several cities in the same country may submit an application .
In fact , some of our financing mechanisms were devised at a time when enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe was no more than a distant prospect .
For the current year 1999 , for example , EUR 2@@ 16 billion is budge@@ ted for regional policy .
I would therefore urge that this should be taken into account in the report in future , and this is the purpose of the amendment by the Committee on Budgets .
Europe must therefore cease being an economic giant and a political d@@ warf .
We are currently investigating whether a legal basis exists for this .
If we want to be consistent , these gains are necessary , and they are possible as well .
Finally , to indicate the complexity of the matter and the pan@@ op@@ ly of instruments through which the Commission - which is particularly active in this area - is addressing the problem , I should mention that we have proposed two draft directives on the issu@@ ance of electronic money .
They are too optimistic .
Madam President , I apologise for having to raise this issue again . It is one I have addressed before .
Unfortunately , it explo@@ its this good idea in that it harmon@@ ises , or begins to harmonise , a statute at European level , in which the European Parliament , in particular , would be the employer , even if the Member himself was naturally free to hire and fire his staff .
The Berlin summit , which will focus solely on Agenda 2000 , is of particular importance for the future of the European Union .
Should it be progressive , as Spain hopes , proportional to wealth , or a head tax ?
There are many progressive elements in Cuban society , for example a level of social justice which for the region is advanced , and endeavours in the field of education and health care .
The course of history will not be changed by res@@ or@@ ting to using violence against the weak .
This report goes considerably further in the quest for harmonisation and in making proposals in fields such as child care and pensions .
Il@@ liter@@ acy affected 84 % of the population whereas now over half of the population can read .
The proposed partnership agreement is part of a new generation of agreements aimed at re@@ defining the external action of the European Union .
We hope that the EU @-@ India dialogue will allow India to assume its ri@@ ghtful place on the world stage and that it will allow our Asia strategy to be revised so that it is not solely targeted at China .
It would be extremely difficult for funds to be em@@ be@@ zz@@ led or mis@@ used under these circumstances , given also that the use of official reserves is subject to constant supervision by the IMF .
Things that had been going on for years unbe@@ known to many people have now been brought to light by this report of the Committee of W@@ ise Men .
Thank you , Sir Leon .
Let us accept this proposal as it stands !
Its tasks must be set out clearly , and the necessary syn@@ ergies must be developed with the Member States , with regional organisations - first and foremost the European Union - and with other international institutions .
To tackle this as quickly as possible , the rapporteur is suggesting that 50 % of the payment appropriations should be included in the budget for 2000 .
Mr President , when the Commission re@@ signed it decided to continue to carry out its essential legal functions and obligations .
Police and customs success should not be measured just by arre@@ sts but by success in bringing criminal organisations to justice .
Thank you , Mrs Ter@@ r@@ ón i Cus@@ í .
All proposed measures in the justice field must be brought before the European Parliament .
It is only then that we can build the kind of Europe that I would like to see .
It is important to make this point , as pe@@ at is and will be of tremendous importance in the Nordic countries and Ireland too , for example . The second point is this .
So far as dele@@ tion of the initial stage of the minimum levels of taxation is concerned , it is true that the operative date of 1 January 1998 belongs to the past .
Mi@@ xed reactions
This is particularly important , since the Council &apos;s strategy is still heavily marked by repression and a reluct@@ ance to accept responsibility .
Finally , I agree that the funding is excessively limited , lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us@@ ly so , for a promotion campaign such as this , given the present cost of advertising .
You are no@@ dding ; it seems then that there have been more recent developments .
To P@@ at the C@@ ope Gal@@ la@@ gher I would say that the Committee on Fisheries agreed to all these matters and we are pleased to have that support .
We would be well @-@ advised to ensure that they are adopted quickly , indeed very quickly , so that we finally have a regulation on the human rights policy .
To achieve that objective , however , we have to tigh@@ ten up the requirements , for example as regards combustion .
The proposal for a Council directive concerns the inciner@@ ation of waste that is not covered by this directive , that is , non @-@ hazardous waste , such as urban waste and certain other types of hazardous waste that are excluded from the scope of the previous directive .
In addition , LIFE needs special funding .
We are talking - as has been emphasised - about a voluntary market instrument aimed at improving the contribution which businesses make to the environment .
That was another test of the common foreign and security policy , for it showed that Europe is a community of values , not just an economic community .
Applause
But if the presidency of the Council had co@@ operated with Parliament on this matter earlier on , in January this year , then we might not have got into this situation at all .
In fact I would like to praise Mr Fischler here .
That is quite incorrect .
We live daily with the problem of the victims of new variant C@@ J@@ D , to which the rapporteurs refer .
If you were asking whether you can draw my attention to a certain situation , then my answer is yes , you may .
I think I may prove you wrong on that point , Mr Konrad .
During the past five years of this mandate 10 million people from all 15 European Union Member States have signed over 6 500 petitions .
The institution of the Ombudsman is answer@@ able to Parliament , which I think is a good thing because it helps him to be independent , a position which he explo@@ its to the full , as we have seen from the report he has presented to Parliament today .
Furthermore , improving the relationship between citizens and the administration also implies substantially enhancing transparency and giving the public easier access to documentation .
For all these reasons , I voted against the compromise resolution adopted on Kosovo , and in particular against the immen@@ sely hypo@@ critical recital H - which bl@@ ames the UN for the fact that NATO violated the United Nations Charter - and against paragraph 2 , which tries to legitim@@ ise the bombing by pre@@ tending that it has nothing to do with us .
First , I do not know whether the idea of a multi @-@ ethnic Kosovo ever had any basis in reality , but I am sure that any such idea is dead today , wi@@ ped out by NATO &apos;s bombing campaign .
Of course , there are all sorts of practical problems involved and there is naturally opposition to the idea , as we have seen in the Netherlands , especially if it is not made clear that the investment and charges are needed to keep den@@ sely populated areas liv@@ able and accessible .
Are we , for example , to replace the 11 banking directives , the eight directives on investment services , the 21 directives on insurance as well as the interpre@@ tive texts , and if so , what are we to replace them with ?
Ad@@ mittedly , the system of countries such as N@@ iger is barely compatible with the fragile processes of democratisation , and this has been demonstrated in recent months with the ann@@ ul@@ ment of the regional , provincial and local elections in which the opposition held the day .
My arrival at the European Parliament coinci@@ ded with a conference which Parliament organised on violence against children and child abuse , and I resolved to investigate this issue in depth here in the House .
The Commission is happy to accept most of them .
The sitting was closed at 7.@@ 45 p.m .
Fif@@ ty @-@ one percent of all men seeking work are in the 50 @-@ 64 age group . There will probably be some Members , like myself , who are in a similar position after 13 June .
Unless society changes its thinking , not even legally enfor@@ ce@@ able rights will do any good .
In my opinion , the public sector should set an example to employers and be capable of thinking in the longer term .
We in Parliament have been sta@@ unch advocates of the European Bus and have expressed the view that getting on and off public transport must be made easier , or indeed possible , for elderly people .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
We would like to take the opportunity provided by the 1997 discharge document to draw attention to the fact that the necessary resources should be made available to the Committee on Budgetary Control to allow it to monitor the appropriations granted to the political groups and the expenses incurred by the sec@@ retari@@ al services .
Our responsibility is to work , but undertaking a commitment to changes of a political character is for the next Commission .
President Prodi , we are impressed by what you have said .
But the lessons we have to learn from current events go much further than that .
&apos;@@ The impossible status quo &apos; was the title of the document of the Florence Group .
Such a development would alter the nature of collective negotiations , ignore the role of the inter@@ relation of forces in determining the contents of collective agreements and , finally , transform trade unions into mere enfor@@ cers of government decisions .
Some veter@@ ans from the Spanish Civil War were in the public gallery yesterday .
I think it is quite clear where the responsibilities lie here , at least as regards the European Union , for resolving not so much problems far afield as those in our own back@@ yard .
Mr President , I am aware of the bad parliamentary hab@@ it of writing one &apos;s speeches in advance and then making them without listening to the rest of the debate .
So I am not sure if your question was meant for me , but I will assume it is .
Secondly , as regards conciliation , it is important to emphasise that the procedures have been stream@@ lined .
When I was young , I was taught that that was the only way to act in politics with dignity , and I have tried not to forget that .
The next item is the joint debate on :
I congratulate the German Presidency of the Council for its decision to hold the Intergovernmental Conference although it may find that this should take place using a Community procedure .
We must exploit and strengthen that trend .
My last point goes back to what Mr T@@ inde@@ mans and others have said .
And all in all I am optimistic , because the situation we now find ourselves in truly does force us to draw the conclusions that should have been drawn a long time ago .
It is your privilege , by the adoption of the legislative proposals on Agenda 2000 , to lay an important foundation stone not just for fulfilling the expectations of our people but also for the Europe of the future .
The CFSP should never have been established . It is mis@@ guided .
That takes me to the fourth point . The money that will now flow from Brussels and from the national treas@@ uries into the large @-@ scale ration@@ alised holdings will be used by them for further ration@@ alisation and growth .
This was sum@@ med up in the resolution we approved in Brussels on 4 December 1997 .
Let me remind you that in 1991 all the experts could and did assume that Iraq could have complied with Resolution 6@@ 87 on a basis of full cooperation within the space of a few months .
I would like to ask you this : will you in no way take responsibility for this ?
The people of these areas will be pen@@ alised , and that hardly helps to demonstrate that the European Union is working for the development of the less @-@ favoured regions .
This is why the guidelines and multiannual programmes must be drawn up for each country and for each sector .
That way we will make sure that parliamentary rights are properly preserved and yet have continuity as we should in the budgetary process .
However , there are certain elements here that we find very hard to s@@ wal@@ low because they are completely contrary to the recommendations that Parliament made in January .
Therefore , as a member of the Socialist Group , I should like to express my support for the proposal for a directive as proposed by Mrs Od@@ dy .
These amendments were properly adopted and were presented to the House within the prescribed time @-@ limit .
The version that was available there this morning for the second reading still indicated the wrong legal basis , namely the Maastricht Treaty .
East Timor is , of course , in a very special position because of its past , and the situation there is explosive , but the concern that we felt has possibly been slightly allevi@@ ated by the New York agreement between Portugal and Indonesia that various people have mentioned .
In any event , as far as the European Union is concerned , I have already told you that provisions have already been made and I can tell you that more are to follow . More specifically , at the request of the Portuguese Government , we have already begun work on the need to step up cooperation with the region , irrespective of the outcome , whilst naturally respecting the will of the people .
It was quite obviously under heavy pressure from representatives of craft and trade feder@@ ations , which would evi@@ dently prefer to revi@@ ve the medieval guil@@ d system .
I think that this will bring us much closer to the people , and we will then be more readily accepted by businesses , have greater room for manoeuvre on the world market and thereby create new jobs .
As we know and are extremely happy to see , many businesses are taking advantage of the single market to operate in other countries and now have si@@ ze@@ able assets in various Member States of the Union .
Thank you , Mrs Lulling .
We are rather sorry to leave it , because this is the historic residence of the European Parliament .
Nonetheless , the vice @-@ chairman , Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten , remains and is a worthy replacement for him .
The European Parliament will play a full role in the reconstruction of Kosovo and stabilisation of the Balkans .
We welcome the fact that the European Council , under the German Presidency , has concluded the work on a European Employment Pact .
For neither the region nor the European Union will be served by Balkan states entering into the race for Brussels on a purely individual basis .
ES@@ PR@@ IT , an important information technology programme designated under Mr Bangemann at the beginning of the Commission as it was in early 1995 , was transferred from originally DG X@@ III which was under Mrs Cres@@ son to Mr Bangemann .
We think that the Council of Ministers was right to inform the Cour@@ ts of Justice , in accordance with article 2@@ 13 of the Treaty , which prohi@@ bits Commissioners from accepting , even after leaving their posts , jobs which would place them in an aw@@ k@@ ward position , given their obligations to be honest and sensitive in these matters .
Council . ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first , I would like to congratulate you all on the election results and wish the European Parliament every success in its legislative work .
As far as the details of this crisis are concerned , I would like to expressly commend the Commission .
Mr Chairman , ladies and gentlemen , you are what you eat .
I shall certainly make the President aware of this , but I think that the first step is to appeal first to the courtesy and public @-@ spiri@@ te@@ dness of our colleagues .
Commissioner Kinnock talked about 180 , 000 tickets being made available to football fans across Europe .
I do not intend to talk about the World Cup in France here , but there are a few general points I wish to make .
It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessments of the risk .
We are perfectly capable of doing so .
That is why we oppose the new Commission .
There are , however , three things I should like to ask you to consider .
Because of his political experience as a national minister and also as chairman of a regional assembly , Mr Barnier is in the best position to understand , apply and trans@@ pose regional policy .
In addition , other recent events , such as the earthqu@@ akes in Turkey and Greece and the recent development in East Timor require those having control of the budget to react swiftly .
This is a matter for both the legal and the administrative authorities .
Un@@ democratic too is the Ech@@ el@@ on programme for collaboration on es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the bilateral agreements between the security services in the USA and the EU countries .
The Irish delegation will vote for President Prodi and the Commission .
The disaster was not unexpected .
Mr President , I would first like to express my sincere regard for the work of the rapporteur , Mrs Dor@@ is Pack .
Yet they took no action , under the pretext of the sp@@ uri@@ ous , hence costly slogan : &quot; Cor@@ ruption is better than Commun@@ ism &quot; .
There are problems , Madam President , but I appreciate that you , Mr Pri@@ est@@ ley and the group who dealt with the complaints from the last session recognise them .
I leave you in the most capable hands possible , those of Mr Pro@@ van .
Mr President , Commissioner Prodi , I think that the statement you have made today demonstrates that the Commission does indeed intend to provide consumers with full guarantees as regards safe and healthy food .
But I have to say to you that we will have to ask you some very hard questions before we can be satisfied that you are moving in the right direction .
Our problem is not about the confidence or lack of confidence of the citizens .
The European Union must assist these countries in providing this minimum care , and more , if possible .
The AL@@ TEN@@ ER programme is an important part of the strategy to reduce carbon @-@ dioxide emissions .
W@@ hol@@ es@@ ale liberalisation in Germany is now already putting both biomass and solar projects under pressure and , in the social sphere , it will also , of course , result in our soon finding ourselves with a lot of little Michelin @-@ style incidents because jobs are being ration@@ alised out of existence so that power companies &apos; share prices rise .
Fif@@ thly : support for social institutions .
I am very aware of the importance of prevention through the work of youth movements .
As the honourable Member knows , we have had discussions with the United States and Canada about small arms , and I very much hope that we can continue to make progress with specific projects in the way he has suggested .
I have allowed you a procedural motion in which you have also dig@@ ressed and indul@@ ged in name @-@ calling .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) - Report ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 14 / 1999 ) by Mrs Jackson , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the Commission communication to the European Parliament and the Council - Eff@@ ects of the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on current legislative procedures pending as at 1 May 1999 in the area of the environment , public health and consumer policy ( SEC ( 1999 ) 05@@ 81 - C4 @-@ 02@@ 19 / 1999 )
Products which South Africa considers sensitive will be placed on a reserve list .
In other words , nothing is agreed until everything is agreed .
The new round of World Trade negotiations which will open in Seattle on 30 November , offers the opportunity to partially extend the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int for world trade , in some fundamental aspects .
Questions relating to transportation and energy are also of decisive importance for the combating of climate change .
Make it one that truly respects the aw@@ ful suffering of the people of Indonesia .
You see , we are closely involved in the ups and down@@ s of the Mol@@ u@@ cc@@ as , one reason for this being that many Mol@@ u@@ cc@@ ans have lived in the Netherlands for a long time now .
It also demonstrates the need not to limit this issue to a national level and to develop a battle strategy on a European scale .
The first prerequisite for doing this is a radical reduction in the number of projects and subsidy schemes the EU operates .
These are the two main components of the interinstitutional agreement .
We know that new forms of business , particularly in the field of e @-@ commerce , are developing .
Amon@@ gst other things , it points the way for the Directive relating to electronic business transactions , for the Directive relating to distance selling and in part for the Directive relating to copyright which will both soon be dealt with at second reading in the European Parliament .
One is the issue of the Members &apos; Statute .
The only thing we do not do is we do not publish votes .
You emphasised , I noted , the disasters of all sorts caused by drugs trafficking and you appe@@ aled to what I shall call our joint responsibility in eradic@@ ating this scour@@ ge .
Money laundering came within the scope of Europol &apos; s mandate .
On the subject of the timetable first of all , ladies and gentlemen , let me express this conviction of mine . This reform is the last opportunity to implement real reform before the greater enlargement of the Union , before the States and the peoples of Europe come together in a great political and economic community .
Today , we should tell it like it is .
Moreover , we need to speed up the re @-@ examination of the Works Council Directive , strengthening information processes and consultation in particular but , I would add , we must also include in that directive the fundamental issue of sanctions . Rules must be obe@@ yed , and those who do not o@@ bey them must pay the price .
A ban on nuclear testing is part and par@@ cel of this process , to the same extent as the continuation of the ST@@ ART process and the veri@@ fiable reduction in fis@@ sion@@ able material .
One of the immediate priorities , particularly as winter approaches , is to ensure humanitarian assistance for the tens of thousands of people displaced by the conflict .
I should like to say on this occasion that the Commission wants to reiterate its support for the Armen@@ ian Government in its efforts to find a rapid and peaceful solution to the situation in the Caucasus .
Community expenditure on culture stands at 0.@@ 00@@ 3 % .
I must also highlight the very positive attitude of the Finnish Presidency , which has also done its best to ensure that work progres@@ ses , and I think that the cooperation established between the two institutions in order to take the negotiation for@@ wards as quickly as possible is quite exemplary .
Bourlanges ( PPE ) , general rapporteur .
However , I also led the majority of the group in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently into voting against paragraph 8 due to an incorrect voting indication .
Transport of dangerous goods by rail
There is nothing to ensure that only animals born after 1 August 1996 , aged between 6 and 30 months , are put on the market
But this is not the same thing .
All those who have led our countries into mad agricultural practi@@ ses must be round@@ ly condemned .
In a way both England and France are guilty : it is a case of the pot calling the k@@ ett@@ le black .
However , the Protocol does not contain any international standards regarding the conservation and ra@@ tioning of fish stocks .
Finally , I will continue to insist on a very quick solution .
That office has conducted two tests in the last six months .
Commissioner , would you agree that it is of paramount importance that we have a European solution to this problem and would you accept our congratulations that you have put your best efforts towards that in the events over the weekend .
Still , there is no reason to paint such a som@@ bre picture .
According to the sacred texts of the economy , it means conciliation and policy on revenues , which Mr D@@ ella V@@ ed@@ ova has just reminded us have been around in Italy for some time , with the results he emphasised .
We are also being told of coordination , harmonisation and cohesion ; even striking a balance is mentioned , never con@@ stric@@ tive regulations and detailed laws which would restrict everyone &apos; s freedom .
The difficulties we are now facing in the Transport Council over the legislative proposal the Commission brought forward stem directly from the fact that there was a failure to make progress on a framework agreement on working time in the road sector . It reveals a real sharp contrast to the progress that was made in the maritime sector .
Not included in the description of mobile workers are rail transport workers .
Firstly , with regard to mobile workers , the exclusion of own @-@ account operators from the definition will subject this group to the full rig@@ ours of the original working time directive .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we all know that in the world of politics - I am sorry to say this - politicians always find it more attractive to come up with new ideas and at least launch their initial implementation than to complete and improve on existing , tried and tested concepts that do not attract so much media attention !
I hope that the European citizens whom the whole thing is ultimately intended to help can make more sense of it .
The group pressure predicted actually materi@@ alised .
Certain Members and groups have expressed their concern at the occur@@ ren@@ ces of le@@ aks to the press - a concern which I share - and I think that we should ask the Court of Auditors , as well as the other institutions , to respect the time limits .
. First of all let me express my thanks to the European Parliament and in particular to the rapporteur , Mr Lange , for acting quickly to present the second reading of the report on this dossier .
Through the ST@@ OP programme and through its work in the fields of police and judicial cooperation , the Commission is actively fighting the sexual exploitation of children including child pornography on the Internet .
Thirdly , there is the situation of girls and young women , which merits special attention in all areas of policy , as they are still exposed to particular discrimination not only here in Europe , but all over the world .
In fact , over the past two years , 300@@ ,000 children under the age of 18 have fought in conflicts all over the world , many of whom were recru@@ ited under du@@ ress .
The Council is putting pressure on , as is Parliament .
There are also more and more people moving or em@@ ig@@ rating from one country of the European Union to another in order to live and work there .
I would particularly like to highlight the importance of adopting the proposal for a regulation which constitutes a cornerstone of the creation at Community level of a European legal area .
It is the first step .
Commissioner , as to whether or not there are reports , I have before me a written reply by Mr Di@@ ck@@ son to a written question on these matters which bears the stamp@@ s and se@@ als of all the organisations .
I sincerely feel that within a short period of time we will be able to take decisions on some of the complaints that have been put to the Commission about those delays .
But is it a military super@@ power that the peoples of Europe need ?
Having said this , I would like to emphasise once more - this has fortunately already been done by many speakers - that , to my mind , the power of the European Union is , or should lie , in crisis management and the prevention of conflict .
I do not mean it is impossible , but a host of good wishes - which we all give you ( they are free and cost absolutely nothing ) - will certainly not suff@@ ice . Maybe you need something more tangible .
Our message to our partners is that we are soli@@ dly behind our negotiating leaders in Seattle - as soli@@ dly as the European Alps , I would say .
We@@ eding out violence will only be possible through continued efforts .
The Hau@@ g report does not involve our automatically introducing taxation by the EU , but it opens the door for taxation of this kind , which is bad enough .
This conc@@ ession is now cancelled whilst the other benefits are maintained .
We also propose , and we are agreed upon this , I am sure , that a conference should be held , and that Parliament should participate in this conference .
It nevertheless demands analysis and an acknowled@@ gement that international trade is complex and is characterised by protectionism and by a system which fails to address the implications of subsi@@ dis@@ ed agriculture for the poor .
Over the last few decades , over the recent qu@@ in@@ qu@@ en@@ nia , international trade - Europe is the homeland of David Ric@@ ardo - has allowed us to create wealth , thanks to a new international division of labour . It has also brought about social inclusion and has defeated poverty which , given the growth in population , would have been much worse than it actually is today without international trade .
Mr President , what should be welcomed in the Schwa@@ iger report is the attempt to reconcile what up until now has been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , and the obvious efforts of the rapporteur can be seen right from the first recital , where recognition of the significant increase in world trade thanks to multilateral relations can only stand in contrast to the lack of any substantial reduction in the world &apos; s economic inequalities .
Since 1995 the United States &apos; trade deficit towards us has grown spectac@@ ularly : almost USD 30 billion last year .
This neces@@ sit@@ ates the Member States &apos; at least pursuing their economic policies on the basis of common principles .
The request for urgent procedure is motivated by the fact that it is imperative to respect the interinstitutional commitments on OLAF , implemented by the other institutions concerned .
The Greens are against the system and I think that they are simply refusing to face up to reality !
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Madam President , our Rules of Procedure do not allow for a secondary market in amendments .
The decision is , of course , his .
In the same way , Iran , which executed 66 people last year , would have us believe that the dozens of students arrested and the 13 Jews , were sp@@ ies .
I will also end with a bi@@ b@@ lical quote which is more positive than the one quoted by my colleague .
If you ask him how the social security system of the future will be extended , you will not find anyone who can give you an answer &quot; .
For addressing a matter of public interest , of environmental interest to the whole of Europe .
Finally , being particularly attentive , of course , to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwand@@ a , so that the duty to remember this conflict which already seems far off , some people think too far off , is maintained , it is the role of the European Union , I feel , to stand by the people of Rwand@@ a on this occasion .
Pakistan clearly expects General Musharraf to succeed in stopping a long series of corrupt and illi@@ ber@@ al fac@@ tions .
This is the explanation for our ab@@ sten@@ tion .
The debate is closed .
Nevertheless it is essential in our opinion that this reform is carried out within the time frame laid down .
Although we have clearly decided to abandon ship@@ yard aid , the recent events in South Korea cannot be allowed to lead to a situation where the Union starts to conf@@ use the old @-@ fashi@@ oned ship@@ yard aid with the action based on the 1997 guidelines , which did not relate to competition policy but were purely in line with sustainable development and the &apos; safety of the seas &apos; doctrine .
If this does not happen , if this is globalisation , then there is nothing more to say .
This was not easy , to say the least .
This is why we need a swift but su@@ re@@ foot@@ ed accession process , and I certainly hope the Helsinki Summit will adopt the accession strategy we recommended in October and will decide , provided the necessary conditions are met , to start accession negotiations next year with Bulgaria , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Romania and Slovakia .
In fact , the same applies just as much to public opinion within the EU Member States .
But we are ro@@ ot@@ edly opposed to the maintenance of nuclear weapons in Scottish coastal waters , or coastal waters anywhere in Europe , or the land of Europe .
I should like to thank you , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , for enabling the EU &apos; s foreign and security policy , including its military capability , to be discussed so thoroughly today .
W@@ ishes for the future ought not , however , to be allowed to out@@ strip the historic task of taking advantage now of the historical opportunity to uni@@ fy the whole of Europe .
Could I also say on the broader topic of completing the internal market that , during the Finnish Presidency , we have had some very important strategy papers and they actually require a much higher priority than they are receiving in the Community at the moment .
Finally , I should like to point out that my colleague Chris Patten , who is very sorry that he is unable to be here today due to a foreign policy commitment , and P@@ oul Nielson and I shall issue a communication on the promotion of human rights and democratisation in our external relations .
E@@ ver since the European Council confirmed in December 1997 that Turkey could apply for membership of the EU , efforts have been made to create the opportunity to provide financial aid with a view to promoting economic cooperation and bringing Turkey closer to the EU .
We must be extremely clear in this respect , by stres@@ sing that they are entitled to apply but that it is not in our interest to start these accession negotiations until the Copenhagen criteria , and the political commitments in particular , have been met .
There are especially high levels of nutri@@ ents in the vicinity of rivers flowing into the sea , which shows that large amounts of nit@@ ric and pho@@ sph@@ oric compounds are being carried from the land to the sea .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
The children who left Spain with clean hands will not return to hear this rhetoric again .
To our great relief , the European Central Bank has abandoned its previous stance against fron@@ t@@ loading .
Therefore , careful planning and support is vital .
We should per@@ severe , however , and I would hope that giving Turkey the prospect of membership of the European Union will encourage the Turkish authorities to respect human rights better , to promote democratic practices and to liber@@ ate the occupied part of Cyprus .
Madam President , with your permission I too will comment on the criticism made of the Austrian Commissioner Fischler .
We shall now move on to the request on the fif@@ tieth anniversary of the Geneva Convention .
But that is not all : perhaps these protests served as a pretext for the official participants at Seattle - those with the right to sit round the conference table - not to have to fully assume the political responsibility to negotiate , which , although certainly very difficult is absolutely necessary , precisely as regards social rights and safeguarding our citizens &apos; health . These are negotiations that cannot wait any longer .
We also need to make this clear .
What is it about ?
Lastly , I would just like to say one small thing on the question of damages .
Many of the amendments are designed to accelerate the phase @-@ out sched@@ ules for H@@ CF@@ Cs and meth@@ yl bro@@ mi@@ de , an objective which the Commission certainly shares in the light of their significant and increasing contribution to ozone deple@@ tion .
So I would like to find out from you what you mean by one percent in ingredients .
It opens the way to care@@ lessness and in@@ difference on the part of suppliers and producers .
It is a very challenging target .
But actions speak lou@@ der than words .
We hope that the modernis@@ ing influences within Turkish politics and society will now take hold of this opportunity and build on it in a positive way .
But that too is a huge question of principle , and after we have drafted this agenda it will then be met with the differing opinions of Member States .
If you read the conditions , which state that negotiations with Turkey will still not begin and that Turkey will just have candidate status , i.e. no separate legal instrument has been opened , then this means - as it says here - that the UNO must endeavour to settle disputes , which should be settled by 2004 on the basis of UNO resolutions .
Secondly , the proposed exemption per category does not pre@@ suppose that non @-@ competition agreements , entered into with a bre@@ wery with a market share greater than 30 % , are illegal .
I believe - after an 18 months &apos; investigation by a UK newspaper , following your investigation - that time is running out and the car industry now wants to find a settlement to this issue .
I only have to think back to this afternoon and I must say in no uncertain terms that the situation is highly unsatisfactory and that we , the European Parliament , are now being more or less forced to circum@@ vent our own Rules of Procedure in order to rescue and sal@@ vage what can be sal@@ v@@ aged .
In other words , to coin a phrase , fewer chie@@ fs , more Indi@@ ans !
Mr President , Commissioner , a few comments on the Parallel Agreement .
As with music , harmony here does not necessarily mean that everyone is singing exactly the same note , but that the overall effect is harmonious .
In response to the question from Mr Harbour , I would say , as you know , that this concerns state aid schemes which belong to the competence of Mr Monti .
I shall therefore read the Council resolution .
In my opinion , many European citizens derived immense benefit when Parliament and the Council adopted the conciliation solution .
Mr Pap@@ ay@@ ann@@ akis , your report will , of course , follow this statement which will therefore inevitably be later this evening .
I should have put it to the vote .
( The Commissioner replied in the affir@@ m@@ ative ) Mrs Jackson has the floor for a procedural motion .
The Council has offered its support to Mr I@@ gle@@ ton , who is the UN Secretary @-@ General &apos; s special en@@ voy in the Western Sahara , and the Council is prepared to push for a peaceful solution , based on the thorough assessment contained in the UN &apos; s next report .
You did not reply to that , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , and I would like a clearer response .
If national systems are not effective enough , the international community ultimately has the responsibility to see that the law is enforced .
So there were signs .
What does it mean and what could it do ? &quot;
Indeed , the real consumer also takes into account quality , diversity , accessibility and adequate distribution of the total supply of books .
This uniform German language area cannot concentrate purely on the national market or the EU market and the reality lies somewhere between the two .
That is fundamental .
Finally , we need to continue to advocate a form of justice on behalf of the thousands of victims of this terror movement .
For example , FR@@ F 42 million in aid has been approved by the De@@ part@@ mental Council of Py@@ ré@@ n@@ ées @-@ Ori@@ ent@@ ales , FR@@ F 50 million by the Langu@@ edo@@ c @-@ Rous@@ si@@ llon region and FR@@ F 400 000 by the Senate . Finally , the French Government has announced aid of FR@@ F 1.2 billion .
As the Liberals and Social Democrats were still unable to sign the joint resolution which we negotiated , we said we will table proposed amendments which water down our own resolution somewhat , in order to give Members the possibility in the end of voting in favour .
I acknowledge your objection and we shall vote on one amendment at a time .
Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Red@@ ondo for her report and for her excellent explanation of what all this is about and why it is important .
This area can ju@@ stly be described by the phrase &apos; never finished , always on the way &apos; .

This would require an enhanced level of European identity , something which the Union &apos;s political eli@@ tes cannot generate arti@@ fici@@ ally . &amp; # 160 ; But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve , but rather that it would not address the main problem : the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states .

The book launched an international debate on whether the world would soon face immense economic problems due to shor@@ tages of oil and other natural resources - problems that seemed to be pres@@ aged by OP@@ EC &apos;s production cuts eigh@@ teen months later .
The composition of South Africa &apos;s exports to China supports these concerns . In 1993 , advanced manufactured goods accoun@@ ted for 50 % of total exports to China , while raw materials and intermediate goods comp@@ ris@@ ed the remainder .
And the major emerging economies are all slo@@ wing , with Russia practically at a stand@@ still .
That hope is built on all three leaders &quot; need for a period of diplomatic quiet , owing to the difficult domestic challenges that each now faces .

The new &quot; hard &quot; p@@ eso marked the end of Argentina &apos;s infl@@ ationary era , a time when the country showed itself , time and again , as incapable of controlling either its budget , its currency , its inflation or its exchange rate .
Germany might rightly argue that it has followed a relatively la@@ isse@@ z @-@ faire attitude towards trade , and that it should not be punished , despite its chronic surpluses .

Finance ministers talked to other finance ministers more than to their own colleagues , let alone the voters .
Yet these five industries combined employ only 14 million people out of a total labor force of 7@@ 70 million and fewer people than they did a decade ago .
Then again , many apparently sophisticated an@@ alysts may simply be in a state of psychological denial .
And if the coalition government &apos;s budget cuts had improved expectations about future output , that greater confidence would have shown up in higher equity prices - but there is no evidence of this , either .
The outcome , it must be said , was substantive and objective - which is promising in terms of moving from populist pron@@ oun@@ cements to serious dialogue .
Yet , while reform efforts intensi@@ fied throughout Europe in the late 1990 &quot; s both inside and outside of the euro area , there is little evidence that &quot; ins &quot; en@@ acted more far @-@ reaching and significant supply @-@ side reforms than the &quot; outs . &quot;

There are strong parall@@ els to what happened in the United States in the past few years : many families felt crus@@ hed by their debts , so household consumption fell and has yet to recover .
In research that I carried out with Margare@@ t Mc@@ Mill@@ an and Kar@@ en Horn Wel@@ ch , we estimated that the efficiency gains generated by the removal of the export restrictions could not have amoun@@ ted to more than $ 6.@@ 6 million annually , or about 0.@@ 14 % of Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s GDP .
Yet my freedom has left a bitter after@@ taste , because my imprisonment ended only as the war against my country began .
But if the idea of the counter@@ cyc@@ lical buffer is now generally accepted , what of the &quot; nuclear option &quot; to pri@@ ck a bubble : Is it justi@@ fiable to increase interest rates in response to a credit boom , even though the inflation rate might still be below target ?
Hungary is the region &apos;s single worst perform@@ er .
And , by remaining on the si@@ delines , Kh@@ amen@@ ei may have been seeking to show the IR@@ G@@ C that there are limits to its power .
A further ten million school @-@ age girls are married off as child bri@@ des each year , while around 32 million girls are denied the right even to an elem@@ entary education .
And , by protecting the floating exchange @-@ rate regime , the central bank ensures that Chile does not confront the kind of foreign @-@ debt crisis that has hit other Latin American countries .
Even the current account showed a deficit in January .
That view has been v@@ indicated .
It is currently also more sensitive to employment risks than usual , because several thousand small factories in the textile and toy sectors have closed this year as a result of the impact of rising labor costs and the appreci@@ ating ren@@ minbi on profit margins .
But doesn &apos;t China have a regime of strict capital controls that limits citizens from taking more than $ 50,000 per year out of the country ?
Moreover , China &apos;s actual commodity consumption is even lower than the figures suggest .
This should not be surprising , given that Chinese GDP growth , though down significantly from its double @-@ dig@@ it he@@ y@@ day , remains above 6 % .
Without a concerted effort to increase households &quot; share of total income and raise consumption &apos;s share of aggregate demand , growth of consumer products and services on the supply side will remain inadequate .
Meanwhile , there has been some decline in national saving , by perhaps 3.5 percentage points of GDP compared to 2007 ( according to IMF estimates , as official data end in 2013 ) .
There is no need for the US and China to go to war .
But fear of provo@@ king China should not stop Asia &apos;s leaders from seeking a regional security consensus , such as the proposed code of conduct for disputes in the South China Sea .
This is because the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s monopoly on power can be justified only by continued rapid economic growth , without which workers and farmers will lose their jobs , and the urban middle classes their chance of increasing prosperity .
Without a road , you cannot transport resources and finished goods .
Another is to sell off government bonds held by the central bank in order to take money out of circulation - again , just the opposite of what the Fed is now doing .
There is a danger , given China &apos;s size , that this peculi@@ ar &quot; Chinese Ex@@ cep@@ tion@@ alism &quot; could turn into something truly alarming : a global norm .
China &apos;s Sla@@ ve Power
There was no mention of B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai and what his dis@@ miss@@ al meant for China &apos;s domestic politics in this critical year of leadership transition .
That means India &apos;s contribution to global GDP growth is likely to be just 0.@@ 6 percentage points this year - only half the 1.2 @-@ percentage @-@ point boost expected from China .
Past@@ or@@ alists , small producers , and independent farmers simply cannot compete with low retail prices that fail to account for the industry &apos;s &amp; nbsp ; true environmental and health costs .
The euro &apos;s recent rise against the dollar is a case in point : by most accounts , euro bul@@ ls have been re@@ acting to the enormous US current account deficit , a sur@@ ging euro @-@ zone economy , and rising euro interest rates .
Political leaders must create incentives and financial head@@ room for their forces to undergo the necessary changes .
Because no European state can afford to &quot; go it alone , &quot; military reform demands greater integration and information sharing , as control of information will be key in future conflicts .
In Ghana and in much of Africa , a culture of silence exists around same @-@ sex love - a culture that many West@@ ern@@ ers , raised on a belief in rights and openness - find unacceptable .

Self @-@ em@@ power@@ ing technological innovation is all around us , affecting a growing number of people , sectors , and activities worldwide .
Individual farmers do not need any bureaucratic directive to decide whether to plant more pot@@ atoes : an increase in prices creates an incentive to plant more pot@@ atoes ; a decrease in prices is a signal that they should plant less .
But the expert concluded that , despite the alarming number of missi@@ les , they did not constitute a &quot; buil@@ du@@ p . &quot;
Doc@@ tors diagno@@ sed him with tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer .
For example , Portuguese exports increased by about 5 @-@ 6 % per year over the last years , despite challenging external conditions ( Spain is its biggest market ) and a credit c@@ run@@ ch , which made it difficult for expor@@ ters to obtain financing .

China has been a major benefici@@ ary of America &apos;s strong @-@ dollar policy , to which it wed@@ ded its own &quot; weak ren@@ minbi &quot; policy . As a result , China &apos;s trade surplus with the US rose from $ 83 billion in 2001 to $ 25@@ 8 billion in 2007 , just before the recession .
The EU &apos;s debt ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic is uncertain and precarious .
Without dis@@ missing the down@@ side risks , I remain cau@@ ti@@ ously optimistic about the global economy &apos;s prospects .
For example , when I led a review on an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bi@@ al resistance , I learned that copper has powerful anti@@ bac@@ ter@@ ial properties and is an ideal material for use in health @-@ care facilities where bacteria often spread .
